Faisal has been working as a full-stack developer for the past fifteen years. He was the lead developer on [svip.ch](https://svip.ch/) (the Swiss Variant Interpretation Platform), a variant database with a curation interface. He has also worked with the BRCA Challenge on [BRCA Exchange](https://brcaexchange.org/) as a mobile, web, and backend/pipeline developer.

Since starting at the University of Colorado Anschutz in July 2021, he has been primarily engaged in porting applications to Google Cloud, including profiling apps for their resource requirements, writing IaC descriptions of the application stacks, and adding instrumentation.
