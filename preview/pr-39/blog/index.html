      <p data-search="Testing Scientific Software  A Practical Guide for Developers          These blog posts are intended to provide software tips  concepts  and tools geared towards helping you achieve your goals  Viewsexpressed in the content belong to the content creators and not the organization  its affiliates  or employees  If youhave any questions or suggestions for blog posts  please don  8217 t hesitate to reach out   Introduction                    Software testing helps us find bugs in our code which otherwise may go unseen       Scientific software plays a crucial role in research When your software is used to analyze data  simulate models  or derive scientific conclusions  ensuring its correctness becomes critical A small bug can have a significant impact on your results  potentially invalidating months of work  or worse  causing the retraction of published research  for example  see here  Fortunately  software testing can help minimize such risks  giving you more confidence in your code and a greater chance to catch issues early In this guide  we ll walk through key types of software tests  practical advice for using popular testing tools like pytest and doctest  and how you can incorporate these into your scientific development workflow Why testing matters in scienceImagine you ve written a simulation that generates data based on a complex scientific model It works well under some conditions  but during peer review  a colleague finds a subtle bug This bug doesn  8217 t affect small data sets but produces significant errors on larger simulations The consequences You have to revise your paper  and time is lost fixing code There  8217 s also the possibility of bugs taking a long time to find  if ever  potentially leading to erroneous research Testing your software upfront ensures that potential errors are caught early and your scientific conclusions remain valid and robust This article covers how to write code which automates the process of testing your software Testing software without these tools may lead to bespoke assumptions and irrecable outcomes Consider  how can an audience know a software creates a reproducible outcome without  tests they can run and verify themselves Production code vs test code                    Software testing often involves two distinct sections of production or application code alongside testing code       When working with software testing principles it can be helpful to distinguish   8220 production  8221  or   8220 application  8221  code  code which provides some utility besides testing itself  from   8220 test  8221  code  code which will be used to test the production or application code  These are often  but not always  stored in separate directories or components within the project Types of tests for scientific softwareIn software development  tests are typically categorized into several types Each plays a unique role in ensuring your code functions as intended                     Unit tests focus on testing an isolated set of functionality within your code         Unit tests  These validate small  isolated parts of your code  like functions or methods They are one of the most basic forms of testing but extremely valuable  ensuring the correctness of atomic units in your codebase                     Integration tests help ensure multiple software components act as expected together         Integration tests  Once your units of code are tested individually  integration tests ensure software components work together This is especially important in scientific software where different models  algorithms  and data structures interact                     System or end to end tests might include those which check how external software interacts to form a cohesive output with your production code         System   End to End tests  These check the software from a user s perspective For scientific software  this often means running entire workflows or simulations to make sure that everything from data input to output runs smoothly There are also many other different types of tests and testing philosophies which can be found here  https   en wikipedia org wiki Software testing Categorization Testing in PythonTesting in Python is often performed using the built in unittest module or pytest package There is also an additional built in module  doctest  which allows you to test whether statements run as expected within docstrings assert statements are a common part of writing tests in Python We can use assert to determine the truthiness of certain output  see below for an example    we can use the assert statements to determine  the truthiness  or lack thereof  of values assert 1    1  returns Trueassert 1    0  returns FalseThe following examples will be added to a demonstrational repository which can be found here  https   github com CU DBMI demo python software testingIntroduction to pytest          pytest is one of the most popular testing frameworks in Python An advantage to using pytest is that it is widely used  includes many different plugins to extend functionality  and is relatively uncomplicated Getting started with pytestConsider the following project tree structure representing directories and files which is common to pytest projects Note the tests directory  which includes code dedicated to testing the package name package module pytest seeks to run test code with the prefix of test  under the tests directory example project    pyproject toml    src        package name            package module py    tests        test package module pyJust in case  make sure you install pytest into the project  8217 s environment management   use pip to install pytest into an existing environmentpip install pytest  or  add pytest to a poetry environmentpoetry add pytestAssume we have a simple function within package module py which helps us understand whether a given integer is an even number def is even number  int    gt  bool            Determines if a number is even     An even number is divisible by 2 without a remainder     Args         number  int            The number to check     Returns         bool           True if the number is even  False if it is odd            return number   2    0Next  we could create a simple unit test within test package module py for the is even   function def test is even         assert that 2 is detected as an even number    assert is even 2 Once we have the test written  we can use the pytest command through our project environment  run the  pytest  command through your terminalpytest  or  run  pytest  through a poetry environmentpoetry run pytestpytest will automatically find all files starting with test  and run any functions inside them that start with test  It also produces concise output  helping you pinpoint errors quickly See below for an example of what the output might look like  we can see that the single test passed                 test session starts                platform darwin    Python 3 11 9  pytest 8 3 3 pluggy 1 5 0rootdir   example projectconfigfile  pyproject tomlcollected 1 itemtests test package module py                100                  1 passed in 0 00s                 Additional pytest features  Using temporary directories  pytest allows for the creation of temporary directories where test data can be stored for each test run in isolation  This pattern can be helpful for times where you may need to generate and store test data for use among multiple tests   Fixtures  Use pytest fixtures to set up any necessary preconditions for your tests  like loading test datasets    Parameterization  If you need to test multiple inputs on the same function  pytest allows you to parameterize your tests  running the same test function with different values Using doctest for documentation and testing          doctest is another tool which can be used for testing It serves a dual purpose  it embeds tests directly in your documentation by using interactive examples in docstrings This can be a lightweight way to share testable functionality within the documentation for your code Be cautious however  doctests are not generally suitable for large or complex testing Writing doctestsA doctest is simply an example of using a function  placed in docstrings The general pattern follows Python interactive terminal input  denoted by  gt  gt  gt   followed by the expected standard output  which sometimes may be truncated when dealing with large numbers or strings  The Examples section of the docstring below demonstrates what a doctest for our earlier function might look like def is even number  int    gt  bool            Determines if a number is even     An even number is divisible by 2 without a remainder     Args         number  int              The number to check     Returns         bool             True if the number is even  False if it is odd     Examples          gt  gt  gt  is even 2         True         gt  gt  gt  is even 3         False           return number   2    0You can run always run doctests by adding the following to the same module which includes that code if   name         main        import doctest      run doctests within module    doctest testmod  You also can run doctests through pytest by using the   doctest modules command flag This can be helpful for areas where we don  8217 t want to use the if   name         main     pattern   run the  pytest  command through your terminalpytest   doctest modules  or  run  pytest  through a poetry environmentpoetry run pytest   doctest modulesThe output might look like this                test session starts                platform darwin    Python 3 11 9  pytest 8 3 3 pluggy 1 5

                This ensures that the examples in your documentation are always accurate and tested as part of your development cycle Using Hypothesis for testing          Using Hypothesis for testing is a powerful approach for validating the correctness of scientific software By employing the Hypothesis library  you can perform property based testing that generates test cases based on the characteristics of your input data This method allows you to test your functions against a broad range of inputs  ensuring that edge cases and unexpected scenarios are adequately handled What is property based testing Property based testing focuses on verifying that certain properties hold true for a wide range of input values  rather than checking specific outputs for predetermined inputs This contrasts with traditional example based testing  where you specify the exact inputs and outputs  which can take time to imagine or construct individually  Getting started with hypothesisTo begin using Hypothesis in your project  you first need to install the library   use pip to install hypothesis into an existing environmentpip install hypothesis  or  add hypothesis to a poetry environmentpoetry add hypothesisOnce installed  you can write tests that utilize its capabilities  With Hypothesis  you can write a test that asserts properties about even numbers  For instance  all even numbers should return True when passed to the is even function from hypothesis import givenfrom hypothesis strategies import integers given integers   def test is even number      if number   2    0         assert is even number     else         assert not is even number Using the Hypothesis ghostwriterHypothesis also includes a   8220 ghostwriter  8221  CLI which can infer how to write Hypothesis tests given an object from Python code This can help automate the process of writing your test code or provide inspiration for how to construct your Hypothesis tests Caveat emptor  please be sure to review any code generated by the Hypothesis ghostwriter  it may not capture useful tests or edge cases  Given the example code from the above  we could ask the Hypothesis ghostwriter to construct a test for the is even   function as follows   run the command from your activated Python environmenthypothesis write package name module is even  or  run through a poetry environmentpoetry run hypothesis write package name module is evenThe output looks similar but not quite the same as the Hypothesis test we shared above Note that the test name implies and itself employs a technique called fuzzing  or fuzz testing  which is used to help determine where software might break   This test code was written by the  hypothesis extra ghostwriter  module  and is provided under the Creative Commons Zero public domain dedication import package name modulefrom hypothesis import given  strategies as st given number st integers   def test fuzz is even number  int    gt  None     package name module is even number number Benefits of using HypothesisBelow are just a few of the benefits you  8217 ll find with using Hypothesis   Discovering Edge Cases  Hypothesis automatically generates diverse input scenarios  including edge cases that might be overlooked in example based tests   Reduced Boilerplate Code  You can focus on the properties of your functions rather than writing extensive examples for every possible case   Increased Confidence  By validating the behavior of your code against a broader set of inputs  you can be more confident that your scientific software will behave correctly in practice Best practices for scientific software testingNow that you understand some testing tools  here are some best practices for testing scientific software       Write tests early  Incorporate testing from the start  This is crucial  especially when your software are prone to evolving         Test small and test often  Focus on unit tests that cover individual functions and methods Catching small errors early prevents larger problems down the line         Use realistic test data  When testing your functions  prioritize test data that reflects the real world conditions where your software will be applied  Secondarily  use   8220 mock  8221  or synthetically created data when the real data are too large or complex to test quickly  For more on this topic  see   8220 Prefer Realism Over Isolation  8221  from the Test Doubles chapter in the book Software Engineering at Google         Automate your tests  Use tools like pytest and Continuous Integration  CI  services  e g   GitHub Actions  GitLab CI  to run your tests automatically on every commit This ensures that every update is tested  and bugs are identified early         Combine different tests approaches to help diversify your test coverage  Both are essential in scientific software While unit tests help you pinpoint specific issues  integration tests validate that modules work correctly when combined   ConclusionTesting is a vital part of developing scientific software  By using tools like pytest  doctest  and Hypothesis  you can automate the testing process and ensure your codebase remains robust Investing time in writing good tests upfront will save you countless hours in debugging and re running experiments Remember  the correctness of your code is directly tied to the validity of your scientific results By adopting a solid testing strategy  you  8217 re taking a significant step toward ensuring reproducible  reliable  and impactful scientific research Now  you re

Scientific software plays a crucial role in research.
When your software is used to analyze data, simulate models, or derive scientific conclusions, ensuring its correctness becomes critical.
A small bug can have a significant impact on your results, potentially invalidating months of work, or worse, causing the retraction of published research (for example: see here).
Fortunately, software testing can help minimize such risks, giving you more confidence in your code and a greater chance to catch issues early.

In this guide, we’ll walk through key types of software tests, practical advice for using popular testing tools like pytest and doctest, and how you can incorporate these into your scientific development workflow.

blog posts  please don  8217 t hesitate to reach out   Introduction                    Code coverage gives our code protection from the unknown       Test coverage is a crucial aspect of software development that helps ensure your code is reliable and bug free By measuring how much of your code is covered by tests  you can identify untested areas and improve overall quality In this post  we  8217 ll dive into what test coverage is  why it matters  and explore some tools for measuring it Let  8217 s get started What is Code Coverage                     Code which is tested is considered   8216 covered  8217            8220 With tests  we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably  Without them  we really don  8217 t know if our code is getting better or worse   8221   Michael Feathers  Working Effectively with Legacy Code Code coverage  also known as test coverage  refers to the percentage of your code that is executed when your tests run  Wikipedia  Code coverage  Software developers use code coverage as a way to understand areas which may need tests By understanding these metrics  you can get a clearer picture of your code  8217 s reliability Types of Coverage  example lineprint  A line which could be tested for coverage     example statement  potentially multi line statement        1     2     3    example functiondef example       return  An example function    example branchingif 1 in statement     return Trueelse     return FalseLine coverage  statement coverage  function coverage  and branch coverage common metrics used to measure how thoroughly code is tested  but they each focus on different aspects   Line coverage tracks the execution of individual lines of code  indicating whether each line has been run during testing   Statement coverage is similar but considers whether each statement  a single unit of execution  within the code has been executed  regardless of the number of lines   Function coverage checks whether each function or method in the code has been called during the tests  ensuring that all parts of the code  8217 s interface are exercised   Branch coverage  helps verify whether every possible path through control structures  like if else blocks  which are often treated as a single compound statement  has been followed  ensuring that all potential outcomes and decision points are tested Benefits of Test Coverage    8220 If you are testing thoughtfully and well  I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s  I would be suspicious of anything like 100    it would smell of someone writing tests to make the coverage numbers happy  but not thinking about what they are doing   8221   Martin Fowler  Test Coverage High test coverage ensures your code is reliable and less prone to bugs  It helps you identify untested parts of your codebase  facilitating better maintenance and encouraging a culture of quality However  it  8217 s important to balance this with the understanding that striving for 100  coverage can sometimes lead to anti patterns Such anti patterns include writing superficial tests that don  8217 t effectively validate functionality  or spending excessive time on achieving full coverage at the expense of more critical development tasks There are often times where you need to make changes to your code which can cause unforeseen issues to arise  for example  when there  8217 s coupling to other functionality  With good test coverage  you can more confidently refactor code during these occasions  knowing that any issues will be quickly caught by your tests Because of this  implementing code coverage at the beginning of the development process promotes writing cleaner and more reliable code over time If you re working with code that currently has no coverage  there s no time like the present to start Measuring Test CoverageToolsDifferent languages have different tools for measuring code coverage These tools help you visualize and understand your test coverage  making it easier to spot gaps and improve your tests While the implementations may differ in their processing and report formatting  they all follow similar principles Many of these tools are available without additional cost of freely as open source packages Below are just a few languages and common test coverage tools you can use with them   Python  coverage py is a popular open source solution which can be paired with pytest cov  slipcover is a similar coverage tool which can be used with Python   R developers often use covr   C   developers can rely on gcov or LCOV   MATLAB has built in test coverage features through CodeCoveragePlugin PlatformsIn addition to the tools mentioned above there are also various test or code coverage platforms  often software as a service  SaaS  companies  These platforms allow you to integrate the data with your GitHub workflows and often include additional insights like historical data tracking  etc Platforms may be an option to consider when thinking about scale and the type of information you  8217 re interested in viewing See below for some examples of these   Codecov  known for its ease of setup and comprehensive support for various languages  is a popular code coverage reporting tool that integrates with many CI CD services and version control systems   Codacy is a code quality platform that includes code coverage as one of its features   Code Climate is another code quality platform which includes code coverage as one of its features Using coverage py for Measuring Test Coverage in Python                     Source  Coverage py website       coverage py is a powerful tool for measuring code coverage in Python  It  8217 s easy to set up  just install it via pip  or your development environment   run your tests with coverage  and generate reports in various formats By default  coverage py measures statement coverage but it can be configured to measure others  see here for more  Interpreting these reports helps you understand which parts of your code need more testing love A quick example of coverage pyThe following content may help demonstrate how coverage py and test coverage works This example assumes one has installed both coverage py and pytest  a common Python testing framework  using pip  for instance  by using the command pip install coverage pytest    module pydef covered test       return  This test has coverage  def uncovered test       return  This test doesn t have coverage  module py has two functions  one which will be covered by a test and the other which will not   test module pyfrom module import covered testdef test add       assert covered test       This test has coverage  test module py has one test for module covered test module uncovered test remains without a test and won  8217 t be considered as covered by coverage py   first we process test coverage  coverage run  m pytest  then we show the reported output of  processed test coverage  coverage reportName             Stmts   Miss  Cover                                    module py            4      1    75 test module py       3      0   100                                     TOTAL                7      1    86 We use the above coverage py commands to first process test coverage and then to show a report about test coverage afterwards Notice that module py shows it does not have full coverage  indicating a possible area where we can improve testing Integrating Code Coverage Tools with CI CD PipelinesContinuous integration and deployment  CI CD  are essential for modern development workflows By integrating code coverage tools with CI CD pipelines  you can automate the process of checking test coverage Setting up coverage py with GitHub Actions workflows  for example  maintains high standards and can catch issues early Strategies like setting coverage thresholds and failing builds on coverage drops help maintain high standards Comparing current coverage with previous coverage can be done using techniques like hash checks for binary files or storing and comparing coverage reports This ensures you know exactly what  8217 s changed and can act accordingly Pre commit Hooks to Generate coverage py Reports                    Pre commit may be used to help automatically generate coverage reports alongside your source control practices       Pre commit hooks are scripts that run before a commit is finalized You can set up a pre commit hook to run tests and generate coverage reports using coverage py  see the example below  This ensures consistency by comparing reports before and after changes   example  pre commit config yml  See https   pre commit com for more informationrepos       process coverage within local environment    repo  local    hooks         id  code cov gen        name  Generate code coverage        language  system        entry  coverage run  m pytest        pass filenames  false        always run  true      generate xml coverage report and export to a badge      for display within a readme or other documentation     repo  https   github com Weird Sheep Labs coverage pre commit    rev  0 1 1    hooks         id  coverage xml        id  coverage badgeIf there  8217 s a significant drop in coverage  the changes are immediately visible  potentially before the commit even happens This workflow can also help generate metadata for association with a repository  for example  through coverage badge or genbage Pull Request Comment with coverage py Reports                    GitHub Actions workflows can help add coverage reporting capabilities to your pull requests       Another workflow which might be helpful is posting coverage reports when a pull request  PR  is opened  for example  using GitHub Action orgoro coverage  This process involves generating a coverage report during the CI CD pipeline and integrating it with the PR                     Example pull request comment with code coverage details  source  https   github com orgoro coverage        By doing so  developers can immediately see which parts of the code are covered by tests and which are not  enabling them to identify potential gaps in testing This transparency helps maintain high code quality  ensures that new changes are well tested  and encourages best practices in test driven development Final ThoughtsCode coverage is a vital part of software development that helps maintain code quality and reliability  By integrating coverage tools and practices into your workflow  you can ensure your code is thoroughly tested and ready for any changes  Start using Code coverage tools in your projects today and experience the benefits firsthand Additional ResourcesFor further reading and resources  check out the the following

relationships within data In this post  we  8217 ll dive into the world of graph databases  focusing on Kùzu  an embedded graph database and query engine for a number of languages  and Cypher  a powerful query language designed for graph data We  8217 ll explore how these tools can transform your data management and analysis workflows  provide insights into their capabilities  and discuss when it might be more appropriate to use server based solutions Whether you  8217 re a research software developer looking to integrate advanced graph processing into your applications or simply curious about the benefits of graph databases  this guide will equip you with the knowledge to harness the full potential of graph data Tabular Data                    Tabular data is made up up rows  or records  and columns       Data are often stored in a table  or tabular format  where information is organized into rows and columns Each row represents a single record and each column represents attributes of that record Tables are particularly effective for storing and querying large volumes of data with a fixed set of columns and data types Despite its versatility  tabular data can become cumbersome when dealing with complex relationships and interconnected data  where a graph based approach might be more suitable Graph Data                    Graph data is made up of nodes and edges       Graph data represents information in the form of nodes  also called vertices  and edges  connections between nodes  This structure is useful for modeling complex relationships and interconnected data  such as social networks  biological networks  and transportation systems Unlike tabular data  which is often   8220 flattened  8221   treating multidimensional data as singular columns  and often rigid  requiring all new data to conform to a specific schema   graph data allows for more flexible and dynamic representations                     Nodes and edges may have properties in a graph       Nodes and edges act like different kinds of tabular records within the context of graphs Nodes and edges can also have properties  attributes  which further provide description to a graph Properties are akin to columns of a particular record in tabular formats which help describe a certain record  or node  Graph data models are particularly useful for exploring connections  performing path analysis  and uncovering patterns that may require more transformation in tabular formats Graph Databases                    Graph databases store graph data       Graph databases are specialized databases designed to store  query  and manage graph data efficiently They use graph structures for semantic queries  with nodes  edges  and properties being stored directly in the database Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables  graph databases leverage the natural relationships in the data  allowing for faster retrieval and sometimes more intuitive querying of interconnected information This makes them ideal for applications involving complex relationships  such as social networks  supply chain management  and knowledge graphs Graph databases support various query languages and algorithms optimized for traversing and analyzing graph structures Graph Database Querying                    Graph data are typically queried using specialized languages such as Cypher       Graph database querying involves using specialized query languages to retrieve and manipulate graph data Unlike SQL  which often is used for tabular databases  graph databases use languages like Cypher  Gremlin  and SPARQL  which are designed to handle graph specific operations These languages allow users to perform complex queries that traverse the graph  find paths between nodes  filter based on properties  and analyze relationships Querying in graph databases can be highly efficient due to their ability to leverage the inherent structure of the graph  enabling fast execution of complex queries that would be cumbersome and slow in a relational database Cypher Query LanguageMATCH  p Person  name   Alice      FRIEND   gt  friend RETURN friend name  friend ageThis query finds nodes labeled   8220 Person  8221  with the name   8220 Alice  8221  and returns the names and ages of nodes connected to Alice by a   8220 FRIEND  8221  relationship Cypher is a powerful  declarative graph query language designed specifically for querying and updating graph databases Originally developed for Neo4j  one of the most popular graph databases   it is known for its expressive and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to work with graph data Cypher allows users to perform complex queries using simple and readable patterns that resemble ASCII art  making it accessible to both developers and data scientists It supports a wide range of operations  including pattern matching  filtering  aggregation  and graph traversal  enabling efficient exploration and manipulation of graph structures For example  a basic Cypher query to find all nodes connected by a   8220 FRIEND  8221  relationship might look like this  MATCH  a    FRIEND   gt  b  RETURN a  b  which finds and returns pairs of nodes a and b where a is connected to b by a   8220 FRIEND  8221  relationship Kùzu                    Kùzu provides a database format and query engine accessible through Python and other languages by using Cypher queries       Kùzu is an embedded graph database and query engine designed to integrate seamlessly with Python  Rust  Node  C C    or Java software Kùzu is optimized for high performance and can handle complex graph queries with ease Querying graphs in Kùzu is performed using the Cypher syntax  providing transferrability of queries in multiple programming languages Kùzu also provides direct integration with export formats that allow for efficient data analysis or processing such as Pandas and Arrow Kùzu is particularly suitable for software developers who need to integrate graph database capabilities into their projects without the overhead of managing a separate database server Tabular and Graph Data Interoperation                    Kùzu uses tabular data as both input and output for data operations       Tabular data and graph data can sometimes be used in tandem in order to achieve software goals  one isn  8217 t necessaryily better than the other or supposed to be used in isolation  For example  Kùzu offers both data import and export to tabular formats to help with conversion and storage outside of a graph database This is especially helpful when working with tabular data as an input  when trying to iterate over large datasets in smaller chunks  or building integration paths to other pieces of software which aren  8217 t Kùzu or graph

are also options to export data directly to CSV or Parquet files for times where file based data is preferred Concluding ThoughtsKùzu  with its seamless integration into Python environments and efficient handling of graph data  presents a compelling solution for developers seeking embedded graph database capabilities Its ability to transform and query tabular data into rich graph structures opens up new possibilities for data analysis and application development However  it  8217 s important to consider the scale and specific needs of your project when choosing between Kùzu and more robust server based solutions like Neo4j By leveraging the right tool for the right job  whether it  8217 s Kùzu for lightweight embedded applications or a server based database for enterprise scale operations  developers can unlock the full potential of graph data  Embracing these technologies allows for deeper insights  more complex data relationships  and ultimately  more powerful and efficient applications ">

8217 t hesitate to reach out   Introduction           Image  Vulphere  Wikimedia Commons Apache Parquet is a columnar and strongly typed tabular data storage format built for scalable processing which is widely compatible with many data models  programming languages  and software systems Parquet files  typically denoted with a  parquet filename extension  are typically compressed within the format itself and are often used in embedded or cloud based high performance scenarios It has grown in popularity since it was introduced in 2013 and is used as a core data storage technology in many organizations This article will introduce the Parquet format from a research data engineering perspective Understanding the Parquet file format           Image  Robert Fischbacher163  Wikimedia Commons Parquet began around 2013 as work by Twitter and Cloudera collaborators to help solve large data challenges  for example  in Apache Hadoop systems  It was partially inspired by a Google Research publication    8220 Dremel  Interactive Analysis of Web Scale Datasets  8221  Parquet joined the Apache Software Foundation in 2015 as a Top Level Project  TLP   link The format is similar and has related goals to that of the ORC  Avro  and Feather file formats One definition for the word   8220 parquet  8221  is    8220 A wooden floor made of parquetry   8221   Wiktionary  Parquet  Parquetry are often used to form decorative geometric patterns in flooring It seems fitting to name the format this way due to how columns and values are structured  see more below   akin to constructing a beautiful   8216 floor  8217  for your data efforts We cover a few pragmatic aspects of the Parquet file format below   Columnar data storage                    Parquet organizes column values together  CSV intermixes values from multiple columns      Parquet files store data in a   8220 columnar  8221  way which is distinct from other formats We can understand this columnar format by using plaintext comma separated value  CSV  format as a reference point CSV files store data in a row orientated way by using new lines to represent rows of values Reading all values of a single column in CSV often involves seeking through multiple other portions of the data by default Parquet files are binary in nature  optimizing storage by arranging values from individual columns in close proximity to each other This enables the data to be stored and retrieved more efficiently than possible with CSV files For example  Parquet files allow you to query individual columns without needing to traverse non necessary column value data  Parquet format abstractionsRow groups  column chunks  and pagesParquet organizes data using row groups  columns  and pages Parquet files organize column data inside of row groups Each row group includes chunks of columns in the form of pages Row groups and column pages are configurable and may change depending on the configuration of your Parquet client Note  you don  8217 t need to be an expert on these details to leverage and benefit from Parquet as these are often configured for default general purposes Page encodingsPages within column chunks may have a number of different encodings Parquet encodings are often selected based on the type of data included within columns and the operational or performance needs associated with a project By default  Plain  PLAIN  encoding is used which means all values are stored back to back Another encoding type  Run Length Encoding  RLE   is often used to efficiently store columns with many consecutively repeated values Column encodings are sometimes set for each individual column  usually in an automatic way based on the data involved  Compressionimport osimport pyarrow as pafrom

Viewsexpressed in the content belong to the content creators and not the organization  its affiliates  or employees  If youhave any questions or suggestions for blog posts  please don  8217 t hesitate to reach out   IntroductionWriting software often entails using code from other people to solve common challenges and take advantage of existing work External software used by a specific project can be called a   8220 dependency  8221   the software   8220 depends  8221  on that external work to accomplish tasks  Collections of software are oftentimes made available as   8220 packages  8221  through various platforms Package management for dependencies  the task of managing collections of dependencies for a specific project  is a specialized area of software development that can involve the use of unique tools and files This article will cover package dependency management through special files generally referred to as   8220 lockfiles  8221  Why use dependencies                       8216 Reinvent the Wheel  8217  comic by Randall Munroe  XKCD       There are various advantages to using packaged dependencies in your projects Using existing work this way practices a collective   8220 don  8217 t repeat yourself  or ourselves   8221   DRY  among the global community of software developers to avoid reinventing the wheel Using dependencies allows us to make explicit decisions about the specific focus  or context  which the project will prioritize While it  8217 s oftentimes easy to include and use dependencies in a project they come with risks that are important to consider See below for a rough list of reasons why one might opt to use specific dependencies in a project   Solutions which entail a lot of edge cases  particularly error prone    Solutions which need constant maintenance  i e  a   8220 frequently moving targets  8221    Solutions which require special domain knowledge or training to correctly implement A common dependency which demonstrates these aspects are those which assist with datetimes  timezones  and time deltas The dependency wildernessDependencies are often on their own unpredictable schedule outside of your project  8217 s control Using existing software package dependencies helps conserve resources but comes with unique challenges related to unpredictability  such as when those dependencies are updated  This unpredictability can sometimes result in what  8217 s colloquially called   8220 dependency hell  8221  or   8220 dependency chaos  8221   where for example multiple external dependencies conflict with one another and are unable to be automatically resolved  among other issues  These challenges can be especially frustrating due to when they occur  often outside of our personal schedule awareness  and how long they can take to debug  finding fixes sometimes entails costly trial and error  It can feel like walking through a forest at night without a flashlight  constantly tripping over roots or running into stumps and branches Illuminating the dependency thicketSoftware dependency choices may be understood through careful consideration between the cost of internal overwhelming invention vs external dependency chaos Dependency chaos can sometimes lead to   8220 not invented here syndrome  8221  where there  8217 s less trust in external facing work outside of an individual or group of people When or if this happens it can be important to understand dependencies as a scale of choices between overwhelming invention and infinite dependency chaos For example  to accomplish a small project it may not be wise to create a brand new programming language  towards the extreme of overwhelming invention  On the other hand  if we depended upon all existing work within a certain context the solution may not be specialized  efficient  or resourceful enough to meet the goals within a reasonable amount of time mindmap  root  Project      Data storage      File 1      Database 2    Data x processing      Package X      Package Y    Integration      Solution A      Platform BDependency awareness and opportunity can be grouped into concerns and documented as part of a literature review  seen here as a mind map  It can be helpful to reconsider existing knowledge on a topic area through formal or informal literature review  understanding that code within software is a type of literature  when thinking about the scale of decisions mentioned above Outlining existing work through a literature review can help with second order thinking revision where we might benefit from reflecting on dependency decision making again after an initial  first order  creative process Each potential dependency discovered through this process can be organized using separation of concerns  SoC  under specific concern labels  or a general set of information which affects related code Include dependencies within your project which will helpfully limit the code produced  or SoC sections  thereby reducing the overall amount of concerns the project must maintain Bounded contexts along with shared or distinct components can be used to help limit the complexity of a project in helpful ways The concept of bounded context from domain driven design can sometimes be used to help distinguish what is in or out of scope for a particular project as a way of reducing complexity Bounded context can be used as a way to draw abstract lines around a certain span of control in order to align available resources  like time and people  with the focus of the project It also can help promote loose coupling of software components in order to enable flexible design over time Without these considerations and the use of dependencies we might face   8220 endless  8221  software feature creep by continually adding new bounded contexts that are outside of our span of control  or resources  Version constraints as dependency specification controlVersion constraintDescription of the version constraint   2 1 0 Exactly and only version 2 1 0  gt  2 0 0 Greater than or equal to version 2 0 0  gt  2 0 0   lt 3 0 0 Greater than or equal to version 2 0 0 and less than 3 0 0  gt  2 0 0   lt 3 0 0    2 5 1 Greater than or equal to version 2 0 0  less than 3 0 0  and anything that s not exactly version 2 5 1Version constraint specifications provide code based descriptions for dependency versions within your project  Pythonic version specification examples above  Many aspects of dependency chaos arise from the fact that dependencies are updated at various times We often want to make certain we use the most up to date version of a dependency because those updates may come with performance  corrective  security  or other benefits To accomplish this we can use what are sometimes called dependency   8220 version range constraints  8221  or   8220 compliant version specifications  8221  to provide some flexibility in how packages are installed for our projects Version ranges are usually preferred to help keep software projects updated and also allow for flexible dependency resolutions  for example  when a single dependency is required by multiple other dependencies  These are often specific to the package management system and programming language being used See the Python Packaging Authority  8217 s Version Specifiers section for an example of how these version constraints work Many version specification constraints build upon ideas from semantic versioning  SemVer  Generally  SemVer uses a dotted three number syntax which includes a major  minor  and patch version separated by periods For example  a SemVer 1 2 3 represents major version 1  minor version 2  patch 3 Developers may use of this type of specification to help differentiate the various releases of their software and help build user confidence about expected operations See the Semantic Versioning specification at https   semver org  for more information about how SemVer works Version constraints can still be chaoticUnintentional failures can occur due to timeline variations between internal projects and external dependencies We sometimes require repeatable behavior to be productive with a project in addition to the flexibility of version range specifications For example  we may want for each developer and continuous integration step to have reproducible environments even if a dependency gets updated while internal development takes place Dependency version constraints oftentimes aren  8217 t enough on their own to prevent reproducibility issues from occurring See the above diagram for a timeline depicting how Developer B and Developer D may have different experiences despite best efforts with version constraints  Dependency A may make a release that fits the version constraint but breaks Project C when Developer D tries to modify unrelated code  Lockfiles for reproducible version constraint behaviorVersion constraint lockfiles provide one way to ensure reproducible behaviors within your projects Lockfiles are usually recommended to be included in source control  so one always has a complete snapshot  short of the literal full source code of the dependencies  of the project  8217 s last known working configuration Lockfiles usually have the following characteristics  this varies by programming language and dependency type    Lockfiles capture data about existing available and installable dependencies which match a provided version constraint specification as a single file which can be added to source control   Lockfiles are referenced when available to help create reproducible installations of dependencies   Lockfiles are often automatically created or changed by a package or environment management tool of some kind   Lockfiles focus on reproducibility of dependency installations and don  8217 t enable dependency resolution on their own  this is instead a part of version range specification and package management tools    Lockfiles are used by developers  automated procedures  as with CI CD procedures   production deployment environments  and elsewhere to help ensure reproducibility See the above modified timeline for Developer B and Developer D to better understand how their project will benefit from a shared lockfile and reproducible dependency installations Pythonic ExamplePython Poetry command usedDescription of what occurs poetry add pandas   Adds a    caret based version constraint specification    https   python poetry org docs dependency specification  caret requirements  based on the latest release  for example   2 2 1   within a  pyproject toml  file  This version constraint can be understood as   gt   2 2 1   lt  2 3 0    Create or update the  poetry lock  lockfile with known compatible versions of Pandas based on the version constraint mentioned above   Installs the version of Pandas which matches the  pyproject toml  and  poetry lock  specifications  poetry install Installs the version of Pandas which matches the  pyproject toml  and  poetry lock  specifications  for example  within a new environment or for another developer   poetry update pandas   Poetry checks for available Pandas releases which are compatible with the version constraint  for ex    2 2 1     If there are new versions available which match the constraint  Poetry will update the  poetry lock  lockfile and install the matching version  poetry lock   Update all dependencies referenced in the  poetry lock  lockfile with the latest compatible versions based on the version constraints specified within the  pyproject toml    Optionally  if the    no update  flag is also used  refresh the dependency versions referenced within the  poetry lock  lockfile based on version constraints specified within the  pyproject toml  without seeking updated dependency releases Use Poetry commands to implement dependency version constraints and lockfiles for reproducible Python project environments Poetry is a Python packaging and dependency management tool which implements version constraints and lockfiles to help developers maintain their software projects Using commands like poetry add     and poetry lock automatically creates poetry lock lockfiles based on specifications which are added either automatically or manually to pyproject toml files Similar to other tools  Poetry can operate with or without poetry lock lockfiles  see here for more information  Another alternative to Poetry which makes use of lockfiles is PDM  pdm lock files  Avoiding over constrained dependenciesAutomated dependency checking tools like Dependabot or Renovate can be used to reduce project risk through timely dependency update changes assisted by human reviewers Using dependency version constraints and lockfiles are helpful for reproducibility but imply a risk of over constraint Two important over constraint considerations are   Bug fixes  we may perpetuate an incorrect or failing solution within our project as the result of not installing later releases of a dependency   Security fixes  we may unknowingly create security risks for others through the inclusion of known security vulnerable dependency versions Make sure to address these risks by routinely considering whether your dependencies need to be updated  manually  or through the use of automated tools like GitHub  8217 s Dependabot or Mend Renovate Tools like Dependabot or Renovate enable scheduled checks and updates to be applied to your project which can lead to a balanced way of ensuring risk reduction and productive future focused development Concluding ThoughtsThis article covered why dependencies are used  what complications they come with  and some tools to use addressing those challenges Every project can vary quite a bit when it comes to dependency management decision making and maintenance We hope you find success with dependency management through these and look forward to providing more information on this topic in the future ">
        
Writing software often entails using code from other people to solve common challenges and take advantage of existing work.
External software used by a specific project can be called a “dependency” (the software “depends” on that external work to accomplish tasks).
Collections of software are oftentimes made available as “packages” through various platforms.
Package management for dependencies, the task of managing collections of dependencies for a specific project, is a specialized area of software development that can involve the use of unique tools and files.
This article will cover package dependency management through special files generally referred to as “lockfiles”.

Viewsexpressed in the content belong to the content creators and not the organization  its affiliates  or employees  If youhave any questions or suggestions for blog posts  please don  8217 t hesitate to reach out   IntroductionHave you ever run Python code only to find it taking forever to complete or sometime abruptly ending with an error like  123456 Killed or killed  program exited with code  137  You may have experienced memory resource or management challenges associated with these scenarios This post will cover some computer memory definitions  how Python makes use of computer memory  and share some tools which may help with these types of challenges What is Software Computer software includes programs  documentation  and other data maintained on computer data storage Computer software is the collection of programs and data which are used to accomplish a specific tasks on a computer   8220 A computer program is a sequence or set of instructions in a programming language for a computer to execute  It is one component of software  which also includes documentation and other intangible components   8221   Wikipedia  Computer program  Computer programs in their human readable form are stored as source code Source code is often maintained on computer data storage What is Memory Computer MemoryComputer memory is a type of computer resource available for use by processes on a computer Computer memory  also sometimes known as   8220 RAM  8221  or   8220 random access memory  8221   or   8220 dynamic memory  8221  is a type of resource used by computer software on a computer   8220 Computer memory stores information  such as data and programs for immediate use in the computer    8230  Main memory operates at a high speed compared to non memory storage which is slower but less expensive and oftentimes higher in capacity    8220   Wikipedia  Computer memory  When we execute a computer program it becomes a process  or sometimes many processes  Processes are loaded into computer memory to follow the instructions and other data provided from their related computer programs           The word   8220 speed  8221  in the above context is sometimes used to describe  the delay before an operation on a computer completes  also known as latency  See the following on  Computer  Latency Numbers Everyone Should Know to better understand relative computer operation speeds   Process Memory SegmentPurposeStackContains information about sequences of program instructions as functions or subroutines HeapArea where memory for variables may be dynamically used Initialized dataIncludes global and static variables which are explicitly initialized Uninitialized dataIncludes global and static variables which are not explicitly initialized TextComprises program instructions for the process Process memory is divided into segments which have specific purposes  The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk  Memory for a process is further divided into parts which are typically called segments Each process memory segment has a specific purpose and way of organizing things For the purposes of this content we  8217 ll focus on two of these segments  the stack and the heap The stack  sometimes also known as the   8220 call stack  8221   includes information about sequences of program instructions packaged as units called   8220 functions  8221  or   8220 subroutines  8221  The stack also typically stores function local variables  arguments  and return value The heap is an area where variables for a program may be dynamically stored The stack can be thought of as a    8220 roadmap  8221  for what program will accomplish  including the location of things it will need to do that work  The heap can be imagined of as a    8220 warehouse  8221  store  or remove  things used as part of the stack   8220 roadmap  8221  Please see The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk  Chapter 6 3  Memory Layout of a Process for more information about processes Memory BlocksA   All memory blocks available BlockBlockBlockB   Some memory blocks in use BlockBlockBlockPractical analogyC   You have limited boxes to hold things    D   Two boxes are used  the other remains empty  ready for use     Memory blocks may be free or used at various times  They can be thought of like reusable buckets to hold things The heap is often further organized through the use of   8220 blocks  8221  Memory blocks are chunks of memory of a certain byte or bit size  usually all the same size   Wikipedia  Block  data storage   Memory blocks may be in use or free at different times If the heap is a process memory    8220 warehouse  8221  then blocks are like    8220 boxes  8221  inside the warehouse Process memory heaps help organize memory blocks on a computer for specific procedures  Heaps may have one or many memory pools Blocks may be organized in hierarchical layers to manage memory efficiently or towards a specific purpose Blocks may sometimes be organized into pools within the process memory heap segment Pools are areas of the heap used to efficiently manage blocks together in specific ways Each heap may have one or many pools  each with sets of blocks  If the heap is a process memory    8220 warehouse  8221   and blocks are like    8220 boxes  8221  inside the warehouse  pools are like    8220 shelves  8221  for organizing and moving those boxes within the warehouse Memory AllocatorMemory allocators help software reserve and free computer memory resources Memory management is a concept which helps enable the shared use of computer memory to avoid challenges such as memory overuse  where all memory is in use and never shared to other software  Computer memory management often occurs through the use of a memory allocator which controls how computer memory resources are used for software Computer software is written to interact with memory allocators to use computer memory Memory allocators may be used manually  with specific directions provided on when and how to use memory resources  or automatically  with an algorithmic approach of some kind  The memory allocator usually performs the following actions with memory  in addition to others      8220 Allocation  8221   computer memory resource reservation  taking memory   This is sometimes also known as   8220 alloc  8221   or   8220 allocate memory  8221      8220 Deallocation  8221   computer memory resource freeing  giving back memory for other uses   This is sometimes also known as   8220 free  8221   or   8220 freeing memory from allocation  8221  Garbage CollectionGarbage collectors help free computer memory which is no longer referenced by software   8220 Garbage collection  GC   8221  is used to describe a type of automated memory management GC is typically used to help reduce human error  avoid unintentional system failures  and decrease development time  through less memory specific code    8220 The garbage collector attempts to reclaim memory which was allocated by the program  but is no longer referenced  such memory is called garbage   8221   Wikipedia  Garbage collection  computer science   A garbage collector often works in tandem with a memory allocator to help control computer memory resource usage in software development How Does Python Interact with Computer Memory Python OverviewA Python interpreter executes Python code and manages memory for Python procedures Python is an interpreted   8220 high level  8221  programming language  Python  What is Python   Interpreted languages are those which include an   8220 interpreter  8221  which helps execute code written in a particular way  Wikipedia  Interpreter  computing   High level languages such as Python often remove the requirement for software developers to manually perform memory management  Wikipedia  High level programming language  Python code is executed by a commonly pre packaged and downloaded binary call the Python interpreter The Python interpreter reads Python code and performs memory management as the code is executed The CPython Python interpreter is the most commonly used interpreter for Python  and what  8217 s use as a reference for other content here There are also other interpreters such as PyPy  Jython  and IronPython which all handle memory differently than the CPython interpreter Python  8217 s Memory ManagerThe Python memory manager helps manage memory in the heap for Python processes executed by the Python interpreter Memory is managed for Python software processes automatically  when unspecified  or manually  when specified  through the Python interpreter The Python memory manager is an abstraction which manages memory for Python software processes through the Python interpreter  Python  Memory Management  From a high level perspective  we assume variables and other operations written in Python will automatically allocate and deallocate memory through the Python interpreter when executed Python  8217 s memory manager performs work through various memory allocators and a garbage collector  or as configured with customizations  within a private Python memory heap Python  8217 s Memory AllocatorsThe Python memory manager by default will use pymalloc internally or malloc from the system to allocate computer memory resources The Python memory manager allocates memory for use through memory allocators Python may use one or many memory allocators depending on specifications in Python code and how the Python interpreter is configured  for example  see Python  Memory Management   Default Memory Allocators  One way to understand Python memory allocators is through the following distinctions     8220 Python Memory Allocator  8221   pymalloc The Python interpreter is packaged with a specialized memory allocator called pymalloc   8220 Python has a pymalloc allocator optimized for small objects  smaller or equal to 512 bytes  with a short lifetime   8221   Python  Memory Management   The pymalloc allocator  Ultimately  pymalloc uses C standard library dynamic memory allocation functions to implement memory work   C dynamic memory allocation functions  malloc  realloc  etc  When pymalloc is disabled or a memory requirements exceed pymalloc  8217 s constraints  the Python interpreter will directly use a function from the C standard library called C standard library dynamic memory allocation functions When C standard library dynamic memory allocation functions are used by the Python interpreter  it uses the system  8217 s existing implementation of the C standard library pymalloc makes use of arenas to further organize pools within a Python process memory heap It  8217 s important to note that pymalloc adds additional abstractions to how memory is organized through the use of   8220 arenas  8221  These arenas are specific to pymalloc purposes pymalloc may be disabled through the use of a special environment variable called PYTHONMALLOC  for example  to use only C standard library dynamic memory allocation functions as seen below  This same environment variable may be used with debug settings in order to help troubleshoot in depth questions Additional Python Memory AllocatorsPython code may stipulate the use of additional memory allocators  such as mimalloc and jemalloc outside of the default Python memory manager  8217 s operation Python provides the capability of customizing memory allocation through the use of custom code or non default packages See below for some notable examples of additional memory allocation possibilities   NumPy Memory AllocationNumPy uses custom C API  8217 s which are backed by C dynamic memory allocation functions  alloc  free  realloc  to help address memory management These interfaces can be controlled directly through NumPy to help manage memory effectively when using the package   PyArrow Memory AllocatorsPyArrow provides the capability to use C standard library dynamic memory allocation functions  jemalloc  or mimalloc through the PyArrow Memory Pools group of functions A default memory allocator is selected for use when PyArrow based on the operating system and the availability of the memory allocator on the system The selection of a memory allocator for use with PyArrow can be influenced by how it performs on a particular system Python Reference

tip of the week  please don t hesitate to reach out to software engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver onmicrosoft com  Introduction                    What good harvests from open source have you experienced this year       Thanksgiving is a holiday practiced in many countries which focuses on gratitude for good harvests of the preceding year In the United States  we celebrate Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November each year often by eating meals we create together with others This post channels the spirit of Thanksgiving by giving our thanks through code as a   8220 Codesgiving  8221    acknowledging and creating better software together Giving Thanks to Open source HarvestsPart of building software involves the use of code which others have built  maintained  and distributed for a wider audience Using other people  8217 s work often comes in the form of open source   8220 harvesting  8221  as we find solutions to software challenges we face Examples might include installing and depending upon Python packages from PyPI or R packages from CRAN within your software projects     8220 Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present   8221   Albert CamusThese open source projects have internal costs which are sometimes invisible to those who consume them Every software project has an implied level of software gardening time costs involved to impede decay  practice continuous improvements  and evolve the work One way to actively share our thanks for the projects we depend on is through applying our time towards code contributions on them Many projects are in need of additional people  8217 s thinking and development time Have you ever noticed something that needs to be fixed or desirable functionality in a project you use Consider adding your contributions to open source All Contributions MatterContributing to open source can come in many forms and contributions don  8217 t need to be gigantic to make an impact Software often involves simplifying complexity Simplification requires many actions beyond solely writing code For example  a short walk outside  a conversation with someone  or a nap can sometimes help us with breakthroughs when it comes to development By the same token  open source benefits greatly from communications on discussion boards  bug or feature descriptions  or other work that might not be strictly considered   8220 engineering  8221  An Open source Contribution ApproachThe troubleshooting process as a workflow involving looped checks for verifying an issue and validating the solution fixes an issue It can feel overwhelming to find a way to contribute to open source Similar to other software methodology  modularizing your approach can help you progress without being overwhelmed Using a troubleshooting approach like the above can help you break down big challenges into bite sized chunks Consider each step as a   8220 module  8221  or   8220 section  8221  which needs to be addressed sequentially Embrace a Learning Mindset    8220 Before you speak ask yourself if what you are going to say is true  is kind  is necessary  is helpful  If the answer is no  maybe what you are about to say should be left unsaid   8221   Bernard MeltzerOpen source contributions almost always entail learning of some kind Many contributions happen solely in the form of code and text communications which are easily misinterpreted Assume positive intent and accept input from others while upholding your own ideas to share successful contributions together Prepare yourself by intentionally opening your mind to input from others  even if you  8217 re sure you  8217 re absolutely   8220 right  8221            Before communicating  be sure to use Bernard Meltzer  8217 s self checks mentioned above   Is what I  8217 m about to say true           Have I taken time to verify the claims in a way others can replicate or understand         Is what I  8217 m about to say kind           Does my intention and communication channel kindness  and not cruelty          Is what I  8217 m about to say necessary           Do my words and actions here enable or enhance progress towards a goal  would the outcome be achieved without them          Is what I  8217 m about to say helpful           How does my communication increase the quality or sustainability of the project  or group          Setting Software Scheduling ExpectationsSuggested ratio of time spent by type of work for an open source contribution   1 3 planning   33    1 6 coding   16    1 4 component and system testing  25    1 4 code review  revisions  and post actions  25  This modified rule of thumb from The Mythical Man Month can assist with how you structure your time for an open source contribution Notice the emphasis on planning and testing and keep these in mind as you progress  the actual programming time can be small if adequate time has been spent on planning  Notably  the original time fractions are modified here with the final quarter of the time spent suggested as code review  revisions  and post actions Planning for the time expense of the added code review and related elements assists with keeping a learning mindset throughout the process  instead of feeling like the review is a   8220 tack on  8221  or   8220 optional   supplementary  8221   A good motto to keep in mind throughout this process is Festina lente  or   8220 Make haste  slowly   8221   take care to move thoughtfully and as slowly as necessary to do things correctly the first time  Planning an Open source ContributionHas the Need Already Been Reported Be sure to check whether the bug or feature has already been reported somewhere In a way  this is a practice of   8220 Don  8217 t repeat yourself  8221   DRY  where we attempt to avoid repeating the same block of code  in this case  the   8220 code  8221  can be understood as natural language  For example  you can look on GitHub Issues or GitHub Discussions with a search query matching the rough idea of what you  8217 re thinking about You can also use the GitHub search bar to automatically search multiple areas  including Issues  Discussions  Pull Requests  etc   when you enter a query from the repository homepage If it has been reported already  take a look to see if someone has made a code contribution related to the work already An open discussion or report of the need doesn  8217 t guarantee someone  8217 s already working on a solution If there aren  8217 t yet any code contributions and it doesn  8217 t look like anyone is working on one  consider volunteering to take a further look into the solution and be sure to acknowledge any existing discussions If you  8217 re unsure  it  8217 s always kind to mention your interest in the report and ask for more information Is the Need a Bug or Feature One way to help solidify your thinking and the approach is to consider whether what you  8217 re proposing is a bug or a feature A software bug is considered something which is broken or malfunctioning A software feature is generally considered new functionality or a different way of doing things than what exists today There  8217 s often overlap between these  and sometimes they can inspire branching needs  but individually they usually are more of one than the other If you can  8217 t decide whether your need is a bug or a feature  consider breaking it down into smaller sub components so they can be more of one or the other Following this strategy will help you communicate the potential for contribution and also clarify the development process  for example  a critical bug might be prioritized differently than a nice to have new feature  Reporting the Need for Change  Using  function x  with  library y  causes  exception z    SummaryAs a  library y  research software developer I want to use  function x  for my data so that I can share data for research outcomes    Reproducing the errorThis error may be seen using Python v3 x on all major OS s usingthe following code snippet    An example of a user story issue report with imagined code example Open source needs are often best reported through written stories captured within a bug or feature tracking system  such as GitHub Issues  which if possible also include example code or logs One template for reporting issues is through a   8220 user story  8221  A user story typically comes in the form  As a  lt  type of user  gt   I want  lt  some goal  gt  so that  lt  some reason  gt    Mountain Goat Software  User Stories  Alongside the story  it can help to add in a snippet of code which exemplifies a problem  new functionality  or a potential adjacent   similar solution As a general principle  be as specific as you can without going overboard Include things like programming language version  operating system  and other system dependencies that might be related Once you have a good written description of the need  be sure to submit it where it can be seen by the relevant development community For GitHub based work  this is usually a GitHub Issue  but can also entail discussion board posts to gather buy in or consensus before proceeding In addition to the specifics outlined above  also recall the learning mindset and Bernard Meltzer  8217 s self checks  taking time to acknowledge especially the potential challenges and already attempted solutions associated with the description  conveying kindness throughout  What Happens After You Submit a Bug or Feature Report When making open source contributions  sometimes it can also help to mention that you  8217 re interested in resolving the issue through a related pull request and review Oftentimes open source projects welcome new contributors but may have specific requirements These requirements are usually spelled out within a CONTRIBUTING md document found somewhere in the repository or the organization level documentation It  8217 s also completely okay to let other contributors build solutions for the issue  like we mentioned before  all contributions matter  including the reporting of bugs or features themselves  Developing and Testing an Open source ContributionCreating a Development WorkspaceOnce ready to develop a solution for the reported need in the open source project you  8217 ll need a place to version your updates This work generally takes place through version control on focused branches which are named in a way that relates to the focus When working on GitHub  this work also commonly takes place on forked repository copies Using these methods helps isolate your changes from other work that takes place within the project It also can help you track your progress alongside related changes that might take place before you  8217 re able to seek review or code merges Bug or Feature Verification with Test driven Development          One can use a test driven development approach as numbered steps  Wikipedia        Add or modify a test which checks for a bug fix or feature addition    Run all tests  expecting the newly added test content to fail     Write a simple version of code which allows the tests to succeed    Verify that all tests now pass    Return to step 3  refactoring the code as needed    If you decide to develop a solution for what you reported  one software strategy which can help you remain focused and objective is test driven development Using this pattern sets a   8220 cognitive milestone  8221  for you as you develop a solution to what was reported Open source projects can have many interesting components which could take time and be challenging to understand The addition of the test and related development will help keep you goal orientated without getting lost in the   8220 software forest  8221  of a project Prefer Simple Over Complex Changes    8230 Simple is better than complex Complex is better than complicated   8230   PEP 20  The Zen of PythonFurther channeling step 3  from test driven development above  prefer simple changes over more complex ones  recognizing that the absolute simplest can take iteration and thought  Some of the best solutions are often the most easily understood ones  where the code addition or changes seem obvious afterwards  A   8220 simplest version  8221  of the code can often be more quickly refactored and completed than devising a   8220 perfect  8221  solution the first time Remember  you  8217 ll very likely have the help of a code review before the code is merged  expect to learn more and add changes during review   It might be tempting to address more than one bug or feature at the same time Avoid feature creep as you build solutions   stay focused on the task at hand Take note of things you notice on your journey to address the reported needs These can be become additional reported bugs or features which could be addressed later Staying focused with your development will save you time  keep your tests constrained  and  theoretically  help reduce the time and complexity of code review Developing a SolutionOnce you have a test in place for the bug fix or feature addition it  8217 s time to work towards developing a solution If you  8217 ve taken time to accomplish the prior steps before this point you may already have a good idea about how to go about a solution If not  spend some time investigating the technical aspects of a solution  optionally adding this information to the report or discussion content for further review before development Use timeboxing techniques to  help make sure the time you spend in development is no more than necessary Code Review  Revisions  and Post actionsPull Requests and Code ReviewWhen your code and new test s  are in a good spot it  8217 s time to ask for a code review It might feel tempting to perfect the code Instead  consider whether the code is   8220 good enough  8221  and would benefit from someone else providing feedback Code review takes advantage of a strength of our species  collaborative  amp  multi perspectival thinking Leverage this in your open source experience by seeking feedback when things feel   8220 good enough  8221  Demonstrating Pareto Principle   8220 vital few  8221  through a small number of changes to achieve 80  of the value associated with the needs One way to understand   8220 good enough  8221  is to assess whether you have reached what the Pareto Principle terms as the   8220 vital few  8221  causes The Pareto Principle states that roughly 80  of consequences come from 20  of causes  the   8220 vital few  8221   What are the 20  changes  for example  as commits  which are required to achieve 80  of the desired intent for development with your open source contribution When you reach those 20  of the changes  consider opening a pull request to gather more insight about whether those changes will suffice and how the remaining effort might be spent As you go through the process of opening a pull request  be sure to follow the open source CONTRIBUTING md document documentation related to the project  each one can vary When working on GitHub based projects  you  8217 ll need to open a pull request on the correct branch  usually upstream main  If you used a GitHub issue to help report the issue  mention the issue in the pull request description using the  issue number  for example  123 where the issue link would look like  https   github com orgname reponame issues 123  reference to help link the work to the reported need This will cause the pull request to show up within the issue and automatically create a link to the issue from the pull request Code Revisions    8220 Perfection is achieved  not when there is nothing more to add  but when there is nothing left to take away   8221   Antoine de Saint ExuperyYou may be asked to update your code based on automated code quality checks or reviewer request Treat these with care  embrace learning and remember that this step can take 25  of the total time for the contribution When working on GitHub forks or branches  you can make additional commits directly on the development branch which was used for the pull request If your reviewers requested changes  re request their review once changes have been made to help let them know the code is ready for another look Post actions and Tidying Up AfterwardsOnce the code has been accepted by the reviewers and through potential automated testing suite s  the content is ready to be merged Oftentimes this work is completed by core maintainers of the project After the code is merged  it  8217 s usually a good idea to clean up your workspace by deleting your development branch and syncing with the upstream repository While it  8217 s up to core maintainers to decide on report closure  typically the reported need content can be closed and might benefit from a comment describing the fix Many of these steps are considered common courtesy but also  importantly  assist in setting you up for your next contributions Concluding ThoughtsHopefully the above helps you understand the open source contribution process better As stated earlier  every little part helps Best wishes on your open source journey and happy Codesgiving References  Top Image  Französischer Obstgarten zur Erntezeit  Le

Implement data quality validation through software testing approaches which leverage ideas surrounding Hoare triples and Design by contract  DbC   Balancing reusability through component based design data testing with Great Expectations or Assertr  For greater specificity in your data testing  use database schema like verification through Pandera or a JSON Schema validator  When possible  practice shift left testing on data sources by through the concept of   8220 database s  as code  8221  via tools like Data Version Control  DVC  and Flyway IntroductionDiagram showing input  in process data  and output data as a workflow Data orientated software development can benefit from a specialized focus on varying aspects of data quality validation We can use software testing techniques to validate certain qualities of the data in order to meet a declarative standard  where one doesn  8217 t need to guess or rediscover known issues  These come in a number of forms and generally follow existing software testing concepts which we  8217 ll expand upon below This article will cover a few tools which leverage these techniques for addressing data quality validation testing Data Quality Testing ConceptsHoare TripleOne concept we  8217 ll use to present these ideas is Hoare logic  which is a system for reasoning on software correctness Hoare logic includes the idea of a Hoare triple      displaystyle  P C Q      where     displaystyle  P     is an assertion of precondition      displaystyle   C    is a command  and     displaystyle  Q     is a postcondition assertion Software development using data often entails  sometimes assumed  assertions of precondition from data sources  a transformation or command which changes the data  and a  sometimes assumed  assertion of postcondition in a data output or result Design by ContractData testing through design by contract over Hoare triple Hoare logic and Software correctness help describe design by contract  DbC   a software approach involving the formal specification of   8220 contracts  8221  which help ensure we meet our intended goals DbC helps describe how to create assertions when proceeding through Hoare triplet states for data These concepts provide a framework for thinking about the tools mentioned below Data Component TestingDiagram showing data contracts as generalized and reusable   8220 component  8221  testing being checked through contracts and raising an error if they aren  8217 t met or continuing operations if they are met We often need to verify a certain component  8217 s surrounding data in order to ensure it meets minimum standards The word   8220 component  8221  is used here from the context of component based software design to group together reusable  modular qualities of the data where sometimes we don  8217 t know  or want  to specify granular aspects  such as schema  type  column name  etc  These components often are implied by software which will eventually use the data  which can emit warnings or errors when they find the data does not meet these standards Oftentimes these components are contracts checking postconditions of earlier commands or procedures  ensuring the data we receive is accurate to our intention We can avoid these challenges by creating contracts for our data to verify the components of the result before it reaches later stages Examples of these data components might include   The dataset has no null values   The dataset has no more than 3 columns   The dataset has a column called numbers which includes numbers in the

project which provides data  contract testing features through the use of component called   8220 expectations  8221  about the data involved These expectations act as a standardized way to define and validate the component of the data in the same way across different datasets or projects In addition to providing a mechanism for validating data contracts  Great Expecations also provides a way to view validation results  share expectations  and also build data documentation See the above example for a quick code reference of how these work Data Component Testing   Assertr  Example using the Assertr package  referenced with modifications from   https   docs ropensci org assertr articles assertr htmllibrary dplyr library assertr   set our data to reference the mtcars datasetour data  lt   mtcars  simulate an issue in the data for contract specificationour data mpg 5   lt   our data mpg 5     1  use verify to validate that column mpg  gt   0our data   gt    verify mpg  gt   0   use assert to validate that column mpg is within the bounds of 0 to infinityour data   gt    assert within bounds 0 Inf   mpg Example code leveraging R package Assertr to perform various data component contract validation Assertr is an R project which provides similar data component assertions in the form of verify  assert  and insist methods  see here for more documentation  Using Assertr enables a similar but more lightweight functionality to that of Great Expectations See the above for an example of how to use it in your projects Data Schema TestingDiagram showing data contracts as more granular specifications via   8220 schema  8221  testing being checked through contracts and raising an error if they aren  8217 t met or continuing operations if they are met Sometimes we need greater specificity than what a data component can offer We can use data schema testing contracts in these cases The word   8220 schema  8221  here is used from the context of database schema  but oftentimes these specifications are suitable well beyond solely databases  including database like formats like dataframes  While reuse and modularity are more limited with these cases  they can be helpful for efforts where precision is valued or necessary to accomplish your goals It  8217 s worth mentioning that data schema and component testing tools often have many overlaps  meaning you can interchangeably use them to accomplish both tasks  Data Schema Testing   Pandera   Example of using the Pandera packagereferenced with modifications from https   pandera readthedocs io en stable try pandera html   import pandas as pdimport pandera as pafrom pandera typing import DataFrame  Series  define a schemaclass Schema pa DataFrameModel      item  Series str    pa Field isin   apple

contract validation DataFrame like libraries like Pandas can verified using schema specification contracts through Pandera  see here for full DataFrame library support  Pandera helps define specific columns  column types  and also has some component like features It leverages a Pythonic class specification  similar to data classes and pydantic models  making it potentially easier to use if you already understand Python and DataFrame like libraries See the above example for a look into how Pandera may be used Data Schema Testing   JSON Schema  Example of using the jsonvalidate R package   Referenced with modifications from   https   docs ropensci org jsonvalidate articles jsonvalidate htmlschema  lt         schema    https   json schema org draft 2020 12 schema     title    Hello World JSON Schema     description    An example     type    object     properties         hello           description    Provide a description of the property here         type    string

datavalidate        validate JSON using schema specification contract and valid datavalidate    hello   world    JSON Schema provides a vocabulary way to validate schema contracts for JSON documents There are several implementations of the vocabulary  including Python package jsonschema  and R package jsonvalidate Using these libraries allows you to define pre  or postcondition data schema contracts for your software work See above for an R based example of using this vocabulary to perform data schema testing Shift left Data TestingEarlier portions of this article have covered primarily data validation of command side effects and postconditions This is commonplace in development where data sources usually are provided without the ability to validate their precondition or definition Shift left testing is a movement which focuses on validating earlier in the lifecycle if and when possible to avoid downstream issues which might occur Shift left Data Testing   Data Version Control  DVC Data sources undergoing frequent changes become difficult to use because we oftentimes don  8217 t know when the data is from or what version it might be This information is sometimes added in the form of filename additions or an update datetime column in a table Data Version Control  DVC  is one tool which is specially purposed to address this challenge through source control techniques Data managed by DVC allows software to be built in such a way that version preconditions are validated before reaching data transformations  commands  or postconditions Shift left Data Testing   FlywayDatabase sources can leverage an idea nicknamed   8220 database as code  8221   which builds on a similar idea about infrastructure as code  to help declare the schema and other elements of a database in the same way one would code These ideas apply to both databases and also more broadly through DVC mentioned above  among other tools  via the concept   8220 data as code  8221  Implementing this idea has several advantages from source versioning  visibility  and replicability One tool which implements these ideas is Flyway which can manage and implement SQL based files as part of software data precondition validation A lightweight alternative to using Flyway is sometimes to include a SQL file which creates related database objects and becomes data documentation ">
        
Data orientated software development can benefit from a specialized focus on varying aspects of data quality validation.
We can use software testing techniques to validate certain qualities of the data in order to meet a declarative standard (where one doesn’t need to guess or rediscover known issues).
These come in a number of forms and generally follow existing software testing concepts which we’ll expand upon below.
This article will cover a few tools which leverage these techniques for addressing data quality validation testing.

      <p data-search="Tip of the Week  Python Packaging as Publishing          Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals  Viewsexpressed in the content belong to the content creators and not the organization  its affiliates  or employees  If youhave any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week  please don t hesitate to reach out to software engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver onmicrosoft com  Python packaging is the craft of preparing for and reaching distribution of your Python work to wider audiences  Following conventions for packaging help your software work become more understandable  trustworthy  and connected  to others and their work   Taking advantage of common packaging practices also strengthens our collective superpowers  collaboration  This post will cover preparation aspects of packaging  readying software work for wider distribution TLDR  too long  didn  8217 t read  Use Pythonic packaging tools and techniques to help avoid code decay and unwanted code smells and increase your development velocity  Increase understanding with unsurprising directory structures like those exhibited in pypa sampleproject or scientific python cookie  Enhance trust by being authentic on source control systems like GitHub  by customizing your profile   staying up to date with the latest supported versions of Python  and using security linting tools like PyCQA bandit through visible   automated GitHub Actions   checks  Connect your projects to others using CITATION cff files  CONTRIBUTING md files  and using environment   packaging tools like poetry to help others reproduce the same results from your code Why practice packaging                     How are a page with some text and a book different       The practice of Python packaging efforts is similar to that of publishing a book  Consider how a bag of text is different from a book  How and why are these things different   A book has commonly understood sequencing of content  i e  copyright page  then title page  then body content pages  8230     A book often cites references and acknowledges other work explicitly   A book undergoes a manufacturing process which allows the text to be received in many places the same way                     Code undergoing packaging to achieve understanding  trust  and connection for an audience       These can be thought of metaphors when it comes to packaging in Python  Books have a smell which sometimes comes from how it was stored  treated  or maintained  While there are pleasant book smells  they might also smell soggy from being left in the rain or stored without maintenance for too long  Just like books  software can sometimes have negative code smells indicating a lack of care or less sustainable condition  Following good packaging practices helps to avoid unwanted code smells while increasing development velocity  maintainability of software through understandability  trustworthiness of the content  and connection to other projects           Note  these techniques can also work just as well for inner source collaboration  private or proprietary development within organizations   Don  8217 t hesitate to use these on projects which may not be public facing in order to make development and maintenance easier  if only for you                8220 Wait  what are Python packages   8221 my package       init   py    module a py    module b pyA Python package is a collection of modules   py files  that usually include an   8220 initialization file  8221    init   py  This post will cover the craft of packaging which can include one or many packages   Understanding  common directory structuresproject directory    README md    LICENSE txt    pyproject toml    docs        source            index md    src        package name              init   py            module a py    tests          init   py        test module a pyPython Packaging today generally assumes a specific directory design Following this convention generally improves the understanding of your code  We  8217 ll cover each of these below Project root filesproject directory    README md    LICENSE txt    pyproject toml       The README md file is a markdown file with documentation including project goals and other short notes about installation  development  or usage  The README md file is akin to a book jacket blurb which quickly tells the audience what the book will be about   The LICENSE txt file is a text file which indicates licensing details for the project  It often includes information about how it may be used and protects the authors in disputes  The LICENSE txt file can be thought of like a book  8217 s copyright page  See https   choosealicense com  for more details on selecting an open source license   The pyproject toml file is a Python specific TOML file which helps organize how the project is used and built for wider distribution  The pyproject toml file is similar to a book  8217 s table of contents  index  and printing or production specification Project sub directoriesproject directory         docs        source            index md    src        package name              init   py            module a py    tests          init   py        test module a py  The docs directory is used for in depth documentation and related documentation build code  for example  when building documentation websites  aka   8220 docsites  8221    The docs directory includes information similar to a book  8217 s   8220 study guide  8221   providing content surrounding how to best make use of and understand the content found within   The src directory  includes primary source code for use in the project  Python projects generally use a nested package directory with modules and sub packages  The src directory is like a book  8217 s body or general content  perhaps thinking of modules as chapters or sections of related ideas    The tests directory includes testing code for validating functionality of code found in the src directory  The above follows pytest conventions  The tests directory is for code which acts like a book  8217 s early reviewers or editors  making sure that if you change things in src the impacts remain as expected Common directory structure examplesThe Python directory structure described above can be witnessed in the wild from the following resources  These can serve as a great resource for starting or adjusting your own work   pypa sampleproject  scientific python cookie  microsoft python package templateTrust  building audience confidence                    How much does your audience trust your work        Building an understandable body of content helps tremendously with audience trust  What else can we do to enhance project trust  The following elements can help improve an audience  8217 s trust in packaged Python work Source control authenticity                    Comparing the difference between a generic or anonymous user and one with greater authenticity       Be authentic  Fill out your profile to help your audience know the author and why you do what you do  See here for GitHub  8217 s documentation on filling out your profile  Doing this may seem irrelevant but can go a long way to making technical work more relatable   Add a profile picture of yourself or something fun   Set your profile description to information which is both professionally accurate and unique to you   Show or link to work which you feel may be relevant or exciting to those in your audience Staying up to date with supported Python releases                    Major Python releases and their support status       Use Python versions which are supported  this changes over time  Python versions which are end of life may be difficult to support and are a sign of code decay for projects  Specify the version of Python which is compatiable with your project by using environment specifications such as pyproject toml files and related packaging tools  more on this below    See here for updated information on Python version status   Staying up to date with supported releases oftentimes can result in performance or other similar benefits  later versions usually include improvements   Security linting and visible checks with GitHub Actions                    Make an effort to inspect your package for known security issues       Use security vulnerability linters to help prevent undesirable or risky processing for your audience  Doing this both practical to avoid issues and conveys that you care about those using your package   PyCQA bandit   checks Python code  pyupio safety   checks Python dependencies  gitleaks  checks for sensitive passwords  keys  or tokens                    The green checkmark from successful GitHub Actions runs can offer a sense of reassurance to your audience       Combining GitHub actions with security linters and tests from your software validation suite can add an observable   for your project This provides the audience with a sense that you  8217 re transparently testing and sharing results of those tests   See GitHub  8217 s documentation on this topic for more information   See also the DBMI Software Engineering Team  8217 s blog post    8220 Automate Software Workflows with Github Actions  8221 Connection  personal and inter package relationships                    How does your package connect with other work and people       Understandability and trust set the stage for your project  8217 s connection to other people and projects  What can we do to facilitate connection with our project  Use the following techniques to help enhance your project  8217 s connection to others and their work Acknowledging authors and referenced work with CITATION cff          Add a CITATION cff file to your project root in order to describe project relationships and acknowledgements in a standardized way  The CFF format is also GitHub compatible  making it easier to cite your project   This is similar to a book  8217 s credits  acknowledgements  dedication  and author information sections   See here for a CITATION cff file generator  and updater  Reaching collaborators using CONTRIBUTING md                    CONTRIBUTING md documents can help you collaborate with others       Provide a CONTRIBUTING md file to your project root so as to make clear support details  development guidance  code of conduct  and overall documentation surrounding how the project is governed   See GitHub  8217 s documentation on   8220 Setting guidelines for repository contributors  8221   See opensource guide  8217 s section on   8220 Writing your contributing guidelines  8221 Environment management reproducibility as connected project reality                    Environment and packaging managers can help you connect with your audience       Code without an environment specification is difficult to run in a consistent way  This can lead to   8220 works on my machine  8221  scenarios where different things happen for different people  reducing the chance that people can connect with a shared reality for how your code should be used     8220 But why do we have to switch the way we do things   8221 We  8217 ve always been switching approaches  software approaches evolve over time   A brief history of Python environment and packaging tooling       distutils  easy install   setup py  primarily used during 1990  8217 s   early 2000  8217 s     pip  setup py   requirements txt  primarily used during late 2000  8217 s   early 2010  8217 s     poetry   pyproject toml  began use around late 2010  8217 s   ongoing   Using Python poetry for environment and packaging management          Poetry is one Pythonic environment and packaging manager which can help increase reproducibility using pyproject toml files  It  8217 s one of many other alternatives such as hatch and pipenv poetry directory structure template useuser machine   poetry new   name package name   src  Created package package name in  user machine   tree       README md    pyproject toml    src        package name              init   py    tests          init   pyAfter installation  Poetry gives us the ability to initialize a directory structure similar to what we presented earlier by using the poetry new     command  If you  8217 d like a more interactive version of the same  use the poetry init command to fill out various sections of your project with detailed information poetry format for project pyproject toml  pyproject toml tool poetry name    package name version    0 1 0 description     authors     username  lt email address gt   readme    README md packages     include    package name   from    src    tool poetry dependencies python     3 9  build system requires     poetry core  build backend    poetry core masonry api Using the poetry new     command also initializes the content of our pyproject toml file with opinionated details  following the recommendation from earlier in the article regarding declared Python version specification  poetry dependency managementuser machine   poetry add pandasCreating virtualenv package name 1STl06GY py3 9 in  pypoetry virtualenvsUsing version  2 1 0 for pandas   Writing lock fileWe can add dependencies directly using the poetry add     command  This command also provides the possibility of using a group flag  for example poetry add pytest   group testing  to help organize and distinguish multiple sets of dependencies   A local virtual environment is managed for us automatically   A poetry lock file is written when the dependencies are installed to help ensure the version you installed today will be what  8217 s used on other machines   The poetry lock file helps ensure reproducibility when dealing with dependency version ranges  where otherwise we may end up using different versions which match the dependency ranges but observe different results  Running Python from the context of poetry environments  poetry run python  c  import pandas  print pandas   version    2 1 0We can invoke the virtual environment directly using the poetry run     command   This allows us to quickly run code through the context of the project  8217 s environment   Poetry can automatically switch between multiple environments based on the local directory structure   We can also the environment as a   8220 shell  8221   similar to virtualenv  8217 s activate  with the poetry shell command which enables us to leverage a dynamic session in the context of the poetry environment Building source code with poetry  pip install git https   github com project package nameEven if we don  8217 t reach wider distribution on PyPI or elsewhere  source code managed by pyproject toml and poetry can be used for   8220 manual  8221  distribution  with reproducible results  from GitHub repositories  When we  8217 re ready to distribute pre built packages on other networks we can also use the following   poetry buildBuilding package name  0 1 0     Building sdist    Built package name 0 1 0 tar gz    Building wheel    Built package name 0 1 0 py3 none any whlPoetry readies source code and pre compiled versions of our code for distribution platforms like PyPI by using the poetry build     command  We  8217 ll cover more on these files and distribution steps with a later post ">
        

Python packaging is the craft of preparing for and reaching distribution of your Python work to wider audiences. Following conventions for packaging help your software work become more understandable, trustworthy, and connected (to others and their work). Taking advantage of common packaging practices also strengthens our collective superpowers: collaboration. This post will cover preparation aspects of packaging, readying software work for wider distribution.

of Python on Alpine  a High Performance Compute  HPC  cluster hosted by the University of Colorado Boulder  8217 s Research Computing We use Python here by way of Anaconda environment management to run code on Alpine This readme will cover a background on the technologies and how to use the contents of an example project repository as though it were a project you were working on and wanting to run on Alpine Diagram showing a repository  8217 s work as being processed on Alpine Table of Contents  Background  here we cover the background of Alpine and related technologies   Implementation  in this section we use the contents of an example project repository on Alpine BackgroundWhy would I use Alpine Diagram showing common benefits of Alpine and HPC clusters Alpine is a High Performance Compute  HPC  cluster HPC environments provide shared computer hardware resources like memory  CPU  GPU or others to run performance intensive work Reasons for using Alpine might include   Compute resources  Leveraging otherwise cost prohibitive amounts of memory  CPU  GPU  etc  for processing data   Long running jobs  Completing long running processes which may take hours or days to complete   Collaborations  Sharing a single implementation environment for reproducibility within a group  avoiding   8220 works on my machine  8221  inconsistency issues  How does Alpine work Diagram showing high level user workflow and Alpine components Alpine  8217 s compute resources are used through compute nodes in a system called Slurm Slurm is a system that a large number of users to run jobs on a cluster of computers  the system figures out how to use all the computers in the cluster to execute all the user  8217 s jobs fairly  i e   giving each user approximately equal time and resources on the cluster   A job is a request to run something  e g  a bash script or a program  along with specifications about how much RAM and CPU it needs  how long it can run  and how it should be executed Slurm  8217 s role in general is to take in a job  submitted via the sbatch command  and put it into a queue  also called a   8220 partition  8221  in Slurm   For each job in the queue  Slurm constantly tries to find a computer in the cluster with enough resources to run that job  then when an available computer is found runs the program the job specifies on that computer  As the program runs  Slurm records its output to files and finally reports the program  8217 s exit status  either completed or failed  back to the job manager Importantly  jobs can either be marked as interactive or batch  When you submit an interactive job  sbatch will pause while waiting for the job to start and then connect you to the program  so you can see its output and enter commands in real time  On the other hand  a batch job will return immediately  you can see the progress of your job using squeue  and you can typically see the output of the job in the folder from which you ran sbatch unless you specify otherwise Data for or from Slurm work may be stored temporarily on local storage or on user specific external  remote  storage           Wait  what are   8220 nodes  8221  A simplified way to understand the architecture of Slurm on Alpine is through login and compute   8220 nodes  8221   computers  Login nodes act as a place to prepare and submit jobs which will be completed on compute nodes  Login nodes are never used to execute Slurm jobs  whereas compute nodes are exclusively accessed via a job Login nodes have limited resource access and are not recommended for running procedures   One can interact with Slurm on Alpine by use of Slurm interfaces and directives A quick way of accessing Alpine resources is through the use of the acompile command  which starts an interactive job on a compute node with some typical default parameters for the job  Since acompile requests very modest resources  1 hour and 1 CPU core at the time of writing   you  8217 ll typically quickly be connected to a compute node  For more intensive or long lived interactive jobs  consider using sinteractive  which allows for more customization  Interactive Jobs One can also access Slurm directly through various commands on Alpine Many common software packages are available through the Modules package on Alpine  UCB RC documentation  The Modules System  How does Slurm work Diagram showing how Slurm generally works Using Alpine effectively involves knowing how to leverage Slurm A simplified way to understand how Slurm works is through the following sequence Please note that some steps and additional complexity are omitted for the purposes of providing a basis of understanding   Create a job script  build a script which will configure and run procedures related to the work you seek to accomplish on the HPC cluster   Submit job to Slurm  ask Slurm to run a set of commands or procedures   Job queue  Slurm will queue the submitted job alongside others  recall that the HPC cluster is a shared resource   providing information about progress as time goes on   Job processing  Slurm will run the procedures in the job script as scheduled   Job completion or cancellation  submitted jobs eventually may reach completion or cancellation states with saved information inside Slurm regarding what happened How do I store data on Alpine Data used or produced by your processed jobs on Alpine may use a number of different data storage locations Be sure to follow the Acceptable data storage and use policies of Alpine  avoiding the use of certain sensitive information and other items These may be distinguished in two ways       Alpine local storage  sometimes temporary   Alpine provides a number of temporary data storage locations for accomplishing your work    Note  some of these locations may be periodically purged and are not a suitable location for long term data hosting  see here for more information  Storage locations available  see this link for full

storage as a service  8221  offerings like Google Drive or Dropbox and or external servers maintained by other groups       How do I send or receive data on Alpine Diagram showing external data storage being used to send or receive data on Alpine local storage Data may be sent to or gathered from Alpine using a number of different methods These may vary contingent on the external data storage being referenced  the code involved  or your group  8217 s available resources Please reference the following documentation from the University of Colorado Boulder  8217 s Research Computing regarding data transfers  The Compute Environment   Data Transfer Please note  due to the authentication configuration of Alpine many local or SSH key based methods are not available for CU Anschutz users As a result  Globus represents one of the best options available  see 3    Transfer data results below   While the Globus tutorial in this document describes how you can download data from Alpine to your computer  note that you can also use Globus to transfer data to Alpine from your computer ImplementationDiagram showing how an example project repository may be used within Alpine

are commonly called   8220 workflow engines  8221   Generally  workflow engines are provided code which indicate beginnings  what triggers a workflow to begin   actions  work being performed in sequence   and an ending  where the workflow stops   There are many workflow engines  including some which help accomplish work alongside version control GitHub Actionsflowchart LR  subgraph workflow

showing GitHub Actions as a workflow GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub which allows you to run workflows in relation to your code as a continuous integration  including automated testing  builds  and deployments  and general automation tool  For example  one can use GitHub Actions to make sure code related to a GitHub Pull Request passes certain tests before it is allowed to be merged  GitHub Actions may be specified using YAML files within your repository  8217 s  github workflows directory by using syntax specific to Github  8217 s workflow specification  Each YAML file under the  github workflows directory can specify workflows to accomplish tasks related to your software work  GitHub Actions workflows may be customized to your own needs  or use an existing marketplace of already created Actions                     Image showing GitHub Actions tab on GitHub website       GitHub provides an   8220 Actions  8221  tab for each repository which helps visualize and control Github

standardized local testing tools  For example  how will you know that a new GitHub Actions workflow will function as expected  or at all  without pushing to the GitHub repository  One third party tool which can help with this is Act  Act uses Docker images which require Docker Desktop to simulate what running a GitHub Action workflow within your local environment  Using Act can sometimes avoid guessing what will occur when a GitHub Action worklow is added to your repository  See Act  8217 s installation documentation for more information on getting started with this tool Nested Workflows

with tools like Dagger There are times when GitHub Actions may be too constricting or Act may not accurately simulate workflows  We also might seek to   8220 write once  run anywhere  8221   WORA  to enable flexible development on many environments  One workaround to this challenge is to use nested workflows which are compatible with local environments and GitHub Actions environments  Dagger is one tool which enables programmatically specifying and using workflows this way  Using Dagger allows you to trigger workflows on your local machine or GitHub Actions with the same underlying engine  meaning there are fewer inconsistencies or guesswork for developers  see here for an explanation of how Dagger works  There are also other alternatives to Dagger you may want to consider based on your usecase  preference  or interest  Earthly is similar to Dagger and uses   8220 earthfiles  8221  as a specification  Both Dagger and Earthly  in addition to GitHub Actions  use container based approaches  which in and of themselves present additional alternatives outside the scope of this article   GitHub Actions with Nested Workflow ExampleReference this example for a brief demonstration of how GitHub Actions and Dagger may be used together       4 run matrixed pytest dagger yml  demonstrates how to run matrixed Python versions for confirming passing pytest tests using GitHub Actions and Dagger together  A GitHub Actions matrix strategy is used to span concurrent work while retaining the reproducibility from Dagger task specification   Closing RemarksUsing GitHub Actions through the above methods can help automate your technical work and increase the quality of your code with sometimes very little additional effort  Saving time through this form of automation can provide additional flexibility accomplish more complex work which requires your attention  perhaps using timeboxing techniques   Even small amounts of time saved can turn into large opportunities for other work  On this note  be sure to explore how GitHub Actions can improve things for your software endeavors ">
        

There are many routine tasks which can be automated to help save time and increase reproducibility in software development. GitHub Actions provides one way to accomplish these tasks using code-based workflows and related workflow implementations. This type of automation is commonly used to perform tests, builds (preparing for the delivery of the code), or delivery itself (sending the code or related artifacts where they will be used).

understood in context with similar workflows from real life  Consider a student taking a course  where an assignment is given to them to complete  In addition to the steps shown in the diagram above  it  8217 s important to think about why this pattern is beneficial   Completing an assignment allows us as social  inter dependent beings to present new findings which enable learning and amalgamation of additional ideas from others   The timebound nature of assignments enables us to practice some form of timeboxing so as to minimize tasks which may take too much time   Segmenting applied learning in distinct  goal orientated chunks helps make larger topics easier to understand Branching to Complete an   8220 Assignment  8221    init     logLevel    debug    theme    default     themeVariables

progress assignment branch based off of the main branch  When the assignment branch is created  we bring into it everything we know from main  the course  so far in the form of commits  or groups of changes to various files  Branching allows us to make consistent and well described changes based on what  8217 s already happened without impacting others work in the meantime   Branching best practices       Keep the name and work with branches dedicated to a specific and focused purpose  For example  a branch named fix links in docs might entail work related to fixing HTTP links within documentation     Consider the use of Github Forks  along with branches within the fork  to help further isolate and enrich work potential  Forks also allow remixing existing work into new possibilities     festina lente or   8220 make haste  slowly  8221   Commits on any branch represent small chunks of a cohesive idea which will eventually be brought to main  It is often beneficial to be consistent with small  gradual commits to avoid a rushed or incomplete submission  The same applies more generally for software  taking time upfront to do things well can mean time saved later

diagram showing assignment branch being merged with main after a review The diagram above depicts a merge from the assignment branch to pull the changes into the main branch  simulating an assignment being returned for review within a course  While merges may be forced without review  it  8217 s a best practice create a Pull Request  PR  Review  also known as a Merge Request  MR  on some systems  and then ask other members of your team to review it  Doing this provides a chance to make revisions before code changes are   8220 finalized  8221  within the main branch   Github provides special tools for reviews which can assist both the author and reviewer       Keep code changes intended for review small  enabling reviewers to reason through the work to more quickly provide feedback and practicing incremental continuous improvement  it may be difficult to address everything at once    This also may denote the git history for a repository in a clearer way     Github comments  Overall review comments  encompassing all work from the branch  and Inline comments  inquiring about individual lines of code  may be provided  Inline comments may also include code suggestions  which allows for code based revision suggestions that may be committed directly to the branch using markdown codeblocks     suggestion        Github issues  Creating issues from comments allows the creation of new repository issues to address topics outside of the current PR   Merging the Branch after Review   init     logLevel    debug    theme    default     themeVariables           git0     6366F1

has been merged  and removed  Changes may be made within the assignment branch until the work is in a state where the authors and reviewers are satisfied  At this point  the branch changes may be merged into main  Approvals are sometimes provided informally  for ex   with a comment    8220 LGTM  looks good to me    8221   or explicitly  for ex   approvals within Github  to indicate or enable branch merge readiness   After the merge  changes may continue to be made in a similar way  perhaps accounting for concurrently branched work elsewhere   Generally  a merged branch may be removed afterwards to help maintain an organized working environment  see Github PR branch removal    Github provides special tools for merging       Decide which merge strategy is appropriate  there are many    There are many merge strategies within Github  merge commits  squash merges  and rebase merging   Take time to understand them and choose which one works best     Consider using branch protection to automate merge requirements  The main or other branches may be   8220 protected  8221  against merges using branch protection rules  These rules can require reviewer approvals or automatic status checks to pass before changes may be merged     Use merge queuing to manage multiple PR  8217 s  When there are many unmerged PR  8217 s  it can sometimes be difficult to document and ensure each are merged in a desired sequence  Consider using merge queues to help with this process   Additional ResourcesThe links below may provide additional guidance on using these git features  including in

      <p data-search="Tip of the Week  Timebox Your Software Work          Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals  Viewsexpressed in the content belong to the content creators and not the organization  its affiliates  or employees  If youhave any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week  please don t hesitate to reach out to software engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver onmicrosoft com  Programming often involves long periods of problem solving which can sometimes lead to unproductive or exhausting outcomes  This article covers one way to avoid less productive time expense or protect yourself from overexhaustion through a technique called   8220 timeboxing  8221   also sometimes referenced as   8220 timeblocking  8221   TLDR  too long  didn  8217 t read  Use timeboxing techniques such as Pomodoro  or 52 17 to help modularize your software work to ensure you don  8217 t fall victim to Parkinson  8217 s Law  Timeboxing may also map well to Github Issues  which allows your software tasks to be further aligned  documented  and chunked in collaboration with others Controlling Work Time Expansion                    Image depicting work as a creature with a timebox around it       Have you ever spent more time than you thought you would on a task  An adage which helps explain this phenomenon is Parkinson  8217 s Law     8220   8230  work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion   8221 The practice of writing software is not protected from this   8220 law  8221   It may be affected by it in sometimes worse ways during long periods of uninterrupted programming where we may have an inclination to forget productive goals One way to address this is through the use of timeboxing techiques  Timeboxing sets a fixed limit to the amount of time one may spend on a specific activity  One can use timeboxing to systematically address many tasks  for example  as with the Pomodoro  Technique  developed by Francesco Cirillo  or 52 17 rule  While there are many ways to apply timeboxing  make sure to balance activity with short breaks and focus switches to help ensure we don  8217 t become overwhelmed Timeboxing Means ModularizationTimeboxing has an auxiliary benefit of framing your work as objective and oftentimes smaller chunks  we have to know what we  8217 re timeboxing in order to use this technique   Creating distinct chunks of work applies for both our daily time schedule as well as code itself  This concept is more broadly called   8220 modularization  8221  and helps to distinguish large portions of work  whether in real life or in code  as smaller and more maintainable chunks             Goals  Finish writing paperVague and possibly large task            Goals  Finish writing paper    Create paper outline    Finish writing introduction    Check for dead hyperlinks    Request internal reviewModular and more understandable tasks  Breaking down large amounts of work as smaller chunks within our code helps to ensure long term maintainability and understandability  Similarly  keeping our tasks small can help ensure our goals are achievable and understandable  to ourselves or others   Without this modularity  tasks can be impossible to achieve  subjective in nature  or very difficult to understand  Stated differently  taking many small steps can lead to a big change in an organized  oftentimes less exhausting way  related graphic  Version Control and Timeboxing  Repo Issues   Prevent foo warning    20 minutes   Remove bar feature    20 minutes   Address baz error    20 minutesList of example version control repository issues with associated time duration The parallels between the time we give a task and related code can work towards your benefit  For example  Github Issues can be created to outline a timeboxed task which relates to a distinct chunk of code to be created  updated  or fixed  Once development tasks have been outlined as issues  a developer can use timeboxing to help organize how much time to allocate on each issue Using Github Issues in this way provides a way to observe task progress associated with one or many repositories  It also increases collaborative opportunities for task sizing and description  For example  if a task looks too large to complete in a reasonable amount of time  developers may work together to break the task down into smaller modules of work Be Kind to Yourself  Take BreaksWhile timeboxing is often a

Programming often involves long periods of problem solving which can sometimes lead to unproductive or exhausting outcomes. This article covers one way to avoid less productive time expense or protect yourself from overexhaustion through a technique called “timeboxing” (also sometimes referenced as “timeblocking”).

Software documentation is sometimes treated as a less important or secondary aspect of software development. Treating documentation as code allows developers to version control the shared understanding and knowledge surrounding a project. Leveraging this paradigm also enables the use of tools and patterns which have been used to strengthen code maintenance. This article covers one such pattern: linting, or static analysis, for documentation treated like code.

The act of creating software often involves many iterations of writing, personal collaborations, and testing. During this process it’s common to lose awareness of code which is no longer used, and thus may not be tested or otherwise linted. Unused code may contribute to “software decay”, the gradual diminishment of code quality or functionality. This post will cover software decay and strategies for addressing unused code to help keep your code quality high.

Diagrams can be a useful way to illuminate and communicate ideas. Free-form drawing or drag and drop tools are one common way to create diagrams. With this tip of the week we introduce another option: diagrams as code (DaC), or creating diagrams by using code.
