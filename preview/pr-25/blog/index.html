  <p data-search="Tip of the Week  Data Quality Validation through Software Testing Techniques          Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals  Viewsexpressed in the content belong to the content creators and not the organization  its affiliates  or employees  If youhave any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week  please don t hesitate to reach out to software engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver onmicrosoft com  TLDR  too long  didn  8217 t read  Implement data quality validation through software testing approaches which leverage ideas surrounding Hoare triples and Design by contract  DbC   Balancing reusability through component based design data testing with Great Expectations or Assertr  For greater specificity in your data testing  use database schema like verification through Pandera or a JSON Schema validator  When possible  practice shift left testing on data sources by through the concept of   8220 database s  as code  8221  via tools like Data Version Control  DVC  and Flyway IntroductionDiagram showing input  in process data  and output data as a workflow Data orientated software development can benefit from a specialized focus on varying aspects of data quality validation We can use software testing techniques to validate certain qualities of the data in order to meet a declarative standard  where one doesn  8217 t need to guess or rediscover known issues  These come in a number of forms and generally follow existing software testing concepts which we  8217 ll expand upon below This article will cover a few tools which leverage these techniques for addressing data quality validation testing Data Quality Testing ConceptsHoare TripleOne concept we  8217 ll use to present these ideas is Hoare logic  which is a system for reasoning on software correctness Hoare logic includes the idea of a Hoare triple      displaystyle  P C Q      where     displaystyle  P     is an assertion of precondition      displaystyle   C    is a command  and     displaystyle  Q     is a postcondition assertion Software development using data often entails  sometimes assumed  assertions of precondition from data sources  a transformation or command which changes the data  and a  sometimes assumed  assertion of postcondition in a data output or result Design by ContractData testing through design by contract over Hoare triple Hoare logic and Software correctness help describe design by contract  DbC   a software approach involving the formal specification of   8220 contracts  8221  which help ensure we meet our intended goals DbC helps describe how to create assertions when proceeding through Hoare triplet states for data These concepts provide a framework for thinking about the tools mentioned below Data Component TestingDiagram showing data contracts as generalized and reusable   8220 component  8221  testing being checked through contracts and raising an error if they aren  8217 t met or continuing operations if they are met We often need to verify a certain component  8217 s surrounding data in order to ensure it meets minimum standards The word   8220 component  8221  is used here from the context of component based software design to group together reusable  modular qualities of the data where sometimes we don  8217 t know  or want  to specify granular aspects  such as schema  type  column name  etc  These components often are implied by software which will eventually use the data  which can emit warnings or errors when they find the data does not meet these standards Oftentimes these components are contracts checking postconditions of earlier commands or procedures  ensuring the data we receive is accurate to our intention We can avoid these challenges by creating contracts for our data to verify the components of the result before it reaches later stages Examples of these data components might include   The dataset has no null values   The dataset has no more than 3 columns   The dataset has a column called numbers which includes numbers in the range of 0 10 Data Component Testing   Great Expectations   Example of using Great ExpectationsReferenced with modifications from  https   docs greatexpectations io docs tutorials quickstart    import great expectations as gx  get gx DataContext  see  https   docs greatexpectations io docs terms data contextcontext   gx get context    set a context data source   see  https   docs greatexpectations

update checkpoint     name  my quickstart checkpoint      validator validator    gather checkpoint expectation resultscheckpoint result   checkpoint run    show the checkpoint expectation resultscontext view validation result checkpoint result Example code leveraging Python package Great Expectations to perform various data component contract validation Great Expectations is a Python project which provides data  contract testing features through the use of component called   8220 expectations  8221  about the data involved These expectations act as a standardized way to define and validate the component of the data in the same way across different datasets or projects In addition to providing a mechanism for validating data contracts  Great Expecations also provides a way to view validation results  share expectations  and also build data documentation See the above example for a quick code reference of how these work Data Component Testing   Assertr  Example using the Assertr package  referenced with modifications from   https   docs ropensci org assertr articles assertr htmllibrary dplyr library assertr   set our data to reference the mtcars datasetour data  lt   mtcars  simulate an issue in the data for contract specificationour data mpg 5   lt   our data mpg 5     1  use verify to validate that column mpg  gt   0our data   gt    verify mpg  gt   0   use assert to validate that column mpg is within the bounds of 0 to infinityour data   gt    assert within bounds 0 Inf   mpg Example code leveraging R package Assertr to perform various data component contract validation Assertr is an R project which provides similar data component assertions in the form of verify  assert  and insist methods  see here for more documentation  Using Assertr enables a similar but more lightweight functionality to that of Great Expectations See the above for an example of how to use it in your projects Data Schema TestingDiagram showing data contracts as more granular specifications via   8220 schema  8221  testing being checked through contracts and raising an error if they aren  8217 t met or continuing operations if they are met Sometimes we need greater specificity than what a data component can offer We can use data schema testing contracts in these cases The word   8220 schema  8221  here is used from the context of database schema  but oftentimes these specifications are suitable well beyond solely databases  including database like formats like dataframes  While reuse and modularity are more limited with these cases  they can be helpful for efforts where precision is valued or necessary to accomplish your goals It  8217 s worth mentioning that data schema and component testing tools often have many overlaps  meaning you can interchangeably use them to accomplish both tasks  Data Schema Testing   Pandera   Example of using the Pandera packagereferenced with modifications from https   pandera readthedocs io en stable try pandera html   import pandas as pdimport pandera as pafrom pandera typing import DataFrame  Series  define a schemaclass Schema pa DataFrameModel      item  Series str    pa Field isin   apple

schema testingtry     Schema validate invalid data except pa errors SchemaError as schema exc     print schema exc Example code leveraging Python package Pandera to perform various data schema contract validation DataFrame like libraries like Pandas can verified using schema specification contracts through Pandera  see here for full DataFrame library support  Pandera helps define specific columns  column types  and also has some component like features It leverages a Pythonic class specification  similar to data classes and pydantic models  making it potentially easier to use if you already understand Python and DataFrame like libraries See the above example for a look into how Pandera may be used Data Schema Testing   JSON Schema  Example of using the jsonvalidate R package   Referenced with modifications from   https   docs ropensci org jsonvalidate articles jsonvalidate htmlschema  lt         schema    https   json schema org draft 2020 12 schema     title    Hello World

There are several implementations of the vocabulary  including Python package jsonschema  and R package jsonvalidate Using these libraries allows you to define pre  or postcondition data schema contracts for your software work See above for an R based example of using this vocabulary to perform data schema testing Shift left Data TestingEarlier portions of this article have covered primarily data validation of command side effects and postconditions This is commonplace in development where data sources usually are provided without the ability to validate their precondition or definition Shift left testing is a movement which focuses on validating earlier in the lifecycle if and when possible to avoid downstream issues which might occur Shift left Data Testing   Data Version Control  DVC Data sources undergoing frequent changes become difficult to use because we oftentimes don  8217 t know when the data is from or what version it might be This information is sometimes added in the form of filename additions or an update datetime column in a table Data Version Control  DVC  is one tool which is specially purposed to address this challenge through source control techniques Data managed by DVC allows software to be built in such a way that version preconditions are validated before reaching data transformations  commands  or postconditions Shift left Data Testing   FlywayDatabase sources can leverage an idea nicknamed   8220 database as code  8221   which builds on a similar idea about infrastructure as code  to help declare the schema and other elements of a database in the same way one would code These ideas apply to both databases and also more broadly through DVC mentioned above  among other tools  via the concept   8220 data as code  8221  Implementing this idea has several advantages from source versioning  visibility  and replicability One tool which implements these ideas is Flyway which can manage and implement SQL based files as part of software data precondition validation A lightweight alternative to using Flyway is sometimes to include a SQL file which creates related database objects and becomes data documentation ">
    
Data orientated software development can benefit from a specialized focus on varying aspects of data quality validation.
We can use software testing techniques to validate certain qualities of the data in order to meet a declarative standard (where one doesn’t need to guess or rediscover known issues).
These come in a number of forms and generally follow existing software testing concepts which we’ll expand upon below.
This article will cover a few tools which leverage these techniques for addressing data quality validation testing.

please don t hesitate to reach out to software engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver onmicrosoft com  Python packaging is the craft of preparing for and reaching distribution of your Python work to wider audiences  Following conventions for packaging help your software work become more understandable  trustworthy  and connected  to others and their work   Taking advantage of common packaging practices also strengthens our collective superpowers  collaboration  This post will cover preparation aspects of packaging  readying software work for wider distribution TLDR  too long  didn  8217 t read  Use Pythonic packaging tools and techniques to help avoid code decay and unwanted code smells and increase your development velocity  Increase understanding with unsurprising directory structures like those exhibited in pypa sampleproject or scientific python cookie  Enhance trust by being authentic on source control systems like GitHub  by customizing your profile   staying up to date with the latest supported versions of Python  and using security linting tools like PyCQA bandit through visible   automated GitHub Actions   checks  Connect your projects to others using CITATION cff files  CONTRIBUTING md files  and using environment   packaging tools like poetry to help others reproduce the same results from your code Why practice packaging                     How are a page with some text and a book different       The practice of Python packaging efforts is similar to that of publishing a book  Consider how a bag of text is different from a book  How and why are these things different   A book has commonly understood sequencing of content  i e  copyright page  then title page  then body content pages  8230     A book often cites references and acknowledges other work explicitly   A book undergoes a manufacturing process which allows the text to be received in many places the same way                     Code undergoing packaging to achieve understanding  trust  and connection for an audience       These can be thought of metaphors when it comes to packaging in Python  Books have a smell which sometimes comes from how it was stored  treated  or maintained  While there are pleasant book smells  they might also smell soggy from being left in the rain or stored without maintenance for too long  Just like books  software can sometimes have negative code smells indicating a lack of care or less sustainable condition  Following good packaging practices helps to avoid unwanted code smells while increasing development velocity  maintainability of software through understandability  trustworthiness of the content  and connection to other projects           Note  these techniques can also work just as well for inner source collaboration  private or proprietary development within organizations   Don  8217 t hesitate to use these on projects which may not be public facing in order to make development and maintenance easier  if only for you                8220 Wait  what are Python packages   8221 my package       init   py    module a py    module b pyA Python package is a collection of modules   py files  that usually include an   8220 initialization file  8221    init   py  This post will cover the craft of packaging which can include one or many packages   Understanding  common directory structuresproject directory    README md    LICENSE txt    pyproject toml    docs        source            index md    src        package name              init   py            module a py    tests          init   py        test module a pyPython Packaging today generally assumes a specific directory design Following this convention generally improves the understanding of your code  We  8217 ll cover each of these below Project root filesproject directory    README md    LICENSE txt    pyproject toml       The README md file is a markdown file with documentation including project goals and other short notes about installation  development  or usage  The README md file is akin to a book jacket blurb which quickly tells the audience what the book will be about   The LICENSE txt file is a text file which indicates licensing details for the project  It often includes information about how it may be used and protects the authors in disputes  The LICENSE txt file can be thought of like a book  8217 s copyright page  See https   choosealicense com  for more details on selecting an open source license   The pyproject toml file is a Python specific TOML file which helps organize how the project is used and built for wider distribution  The pyproject toml file is similar to a book  8217 s table of contents  index  and printing or production specification Project sub directoriesproject directory         docs        source            index md    src        package name              init   py            module a py    tests          init   py        test module a py  The docs directory is used for in depth documentation and related documentation build code  for example  when building documentation websites  aka   8220 docsites  8221    The docs directory includes information similar to a book  8217 s   8220 study guide  8221   providing content surrounding how to best make use of and understand the content found within   The src directory  includes primary source code for use in the project  Python projects generally use a nested package directory with modules and sub packages  The src directory is like a book  8217 s body or general content  perhaps thinking of modules as chapters or sections of related ideas    The tests directory includes testing code for validating functionality of code found in the src directory  The above follows pytest conventions  The tests directory is for code which acts like a book  8217 s early reviewers or editors  making sure that if you change things in src the impacts remain as expected Common directory structure examplesThe Python directory structure described above can be witnessed in the wild from the following resources  These can serve as a great resource for starting or adjusting your own work   pypa sampleproject  scientific python cookie  microsoft python package templateTrust  building audience confidence                    How much does your audience trust your work        Building an understandable body of content helps tremendously with audience trust  What else can we do to enhance project trust  The following elements can help improve an audience  8217 s trust in packaged Python work Source control authenticity                    Comparing the difference between a generic or anonymous user and one with greater authenticity       Be authentic  Fill out your profile to help your audience know the author and why you do what you do  See here for GitHub  8217 s documentation on filling out your profile  Doing this may seem irrelevant but can go a long way to making technical work more relatable   Add a profile picture of yourself or something fun   Set your profile description to information which is both professionally accurate and unique to you   Show or link to work which you feel may be relevant or exciting to those in your audience Staying up to date with supported Python releases                    Major Python releases and their support status       Use Python versions which are supported  this changes over time  Python versions which are end of life may be difficult to support and are a sign of code decay for projects  Specify the version of Python which is compatiable with your project by using environment specifications such as pyproject toml files and related packaging tools  more on this below    See here for updated information on Python version status   Staying up to date with supported releases oftentimes can result in performance or other similar benefits  later versions usually include improvements   Security linting and visible checks with GitHub Actions                    Make an effort to inspect your package for known security issues       Use security vulnerability linters to help prevent undesirable or risky processing for your audience  Doing this both practical to avoid issues and conveys that you care about those using your package   PyCQA bandit   checks Python code  pyupio safety   checks Python dependencies  gitleaks  checks for sensitive passwords  keys  or tokens                    The green checkmark from successful GitHub Actions runs can offer a sense of reassurance to your audience       Combining GitHub actions with security linters and tests from your software validation suite can add an observable   for your project This provides the audience with a sense that you  8217 re transparently testing and sharing results of those tests   See GitHub  8217 s documentation on this topic for more information   See also the DBMI Software Engineering Team  8217 s blog post    8220 Automate Software Workflows with Github Actions  8221 Connection  personal and inter package relationships                    How does your package connect with other work and people       Understandability and trust set the stage for your project  8217 s connection to other people and projects  What can we do to facilitate connection with our project  Use the following techniques to help enhance your project  8217 s connection to others and their work Acknowledging authors and referenced work with CITATION cff          Add a CITATION cff file to your project root in order to describe project relationships and acknowledgements in a standardized way  The CFF format is also GitHub compatible  making it easier to cite your project   This is similar to a book  8217 s credits  acknowledgements  dedication  and author information sections   See here for a CITATION cff file generator  and updater  Reaching collaborators using CONTRIBUTING md                    CONTRIBUTING md documents can help you collaborate with others       Provide a CONTRIBUTING md file to your project root so as to make clear support details  development guidance  code of conduct  and overall documentation surrounding how the project is governed   See GitHub  8217 s documentation on   8220 Setting guidelines for repository contributors  8221   See opensource guide  8217 s section on   8220 Writing your contributing guidelines  8221 Environment management reproducibility as connected project reality                    Environment and packaging managers can help you connect with your audience       Code without an environment specification is difficult to run in a consistent way  This can lead to   8220 works on my machine  8221  scenarios where different things happen for different people  reducing the chance that people can connect with a shared reality for how your code should be used     8220 But why do we have to switch the way we do things   8221 We  8217 ve always been switching approaches  software approaches evolve over time   A brief history of Python environment and packaging tooling       distutils  easy install   setup py  primarily used during 1990  8217 s   early 2000  8217 s     pip  setup py   requirements txt  primarily used during late 2000  8217 s   early 2010  8217 s     poetry   pyproject toml  began use around late 2010  8217 s   ongoing   Using Python poetry for environment and packaging management          Poetry is one Pythonic environment and packaging manager which can help increase reproducibility using pyproject toml files  It  8217 s one of many other alternatives such as hatch and pipenv poetry directory structure template useuser machine   poetry new   name package name   src  Created package package name in  user machine   tree       README md    pyproject toml    src        package name              init   py    tests          init   pyAfter installation  Poetry gives us the ability to initialize a directory structure similar to what we presented earlier by using the poetry new     command  If you  8217 d like a more interactive version of the same  use the poetry init command to fill out various sections of your project with detailed information poetry format for project pyproject toml  pyproject toml tool poetry name    package name version    0 1 0 description     authors     username  lt email address gt   readme    README md packages     include    package name   from    src    tool poetry dependencies python     3 9  build system requires     poetry core  build backend    poetry core masonry api Using the poetry new     command also initializes the content of our pyproject toml file with opinionated details  following the recommendation from earlier in the article regarding declared Python version specification  poetry dependency managementuser machine   poetry add pandasCreating virtualenv package name 1STl06GY py3 9 in  pypoetry virtualenvsUsing version  2 1 0 for pandas   Writing lock fileWe can add dependencies directly using the poetry add     command  This command also provides the possibility of using a group flag  for example poetry add pytest   group testing  to help organize and distinguish multiple sets of dependencies   A local virtual environment is managed for us automatically   A poetry lock file is written when the dependencies are installed to help ensure the version you installed today will be what  8217 s used on other machines   The poetry lock file helps ensure reproducibility when dealing with dependency version ranges  where otherwise we may end up using different versions which match the dependency ranges but observe different results  Running Python from the context of poetry environments  poetry run python  c  import pandas  print pandas   version    2 1 0We can invoke the virtual environment directly using the poetry run     command   This allows us to quickly run code through the context of the project  8217 s environment   Poetry can automatically switch between multiple environments based on the local directory structure   We can also the environment as a   8220 shell  8221   similar to virtualenv  8217 s activate  with the poetry shell command which enables us to leverage a dynamic session in the context of the poetry environment Building source code with poetry  pip install git https   github com project package nameEven if we don  8217 t reach wider distribution on PyPI or elsewhere  source code managed by pyproject toml and poetry can be used for   8220 manual  8221  distribution  with reproducible results  from GitHub repositories  When we  8217 re ready to distribute pre built packages on other networks we can also use the following   poetry buildBuilding package name  0 1 0     Building sdist    Built package name 0 1 0 tar gz    Building wheel    Built package name 0 1 0 py3 none any whlPoetry readies source code and pre compiled versions of our code for distribution platforms like PyPI by using the poetry build     command  We  8217 ll cover more on these files and distribution steps with a later post ">
    

Python packaging is the craft of preparing for and reaching distribution of your Python work to wider audiences. Following conventions for packaging help your software work become more understandable, trustworthy, and connected (to others and their work). Taking advantage of common packaging practices also strengthens our collective superpowers: collaboration. This post will cover preparation aspects of packaging, readying software work for wider distribution.

tip of the week  please don t hesitate to reach out to software engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver onmicrosoft com  This post is intended to help demonstrate the use of Python on Alpine  a High Performance Compute  HPC  cluster hosted by the University of Colorado Boulder  8217 s Research Computing We use Python here by way of Anaconda environment management to run code on Alpine This readme will cover a background on the technologies and how to use the contents of an example project repository as though it were a project you were working on and wanting to run on Alpine Diagram showing a repository  8217 s work as being processed on Alpine Table of Contents  Background  here we cover the background of Alpine and related technologies   Implementation  in this section we use the contents of an example project repository on Alpine BackgroundWhy would I use Alpine Diagram showing common benefits of Alpine and HPC clusters Alpine is a High Performance Compute  HPC  cluster HPC environments provide shared computer hardware resources like memory  CPU  GPU or others to run performance intensive work Reasons for using Alpine might include   Compute resources  Leveraging otherwise cost prohibitive amounts of memory  CPU  GPU  etc  for processing data   Long running jobs  Completing long running processes which may take hours or days to complete   Collaborations  Sharing a single implementation environment for reproducibility within a group  avoiding   8220 works on my machine  8221  inconsistency issues  How does Alpine work Diagram showing high level user workflow and Alpine components Alpine  8217 s compute resources are used through compute nodes in a system called Slurm Slurm is a system that a large number of users to run jobs on a cluster of computers  the system figures out how to use all the computers in the cluster to execute all the user  8217 s jobs fairly  i e   giving each user approximately equal time and resources on the cluster   A job is a request to run something  e g  a bash script or a program  along with specifications about how much RAM and CPU it needs  how long it can run  and how it should be executed Slurm  8217 s role in general is to take in a job  submitted via the sbatch command  and put it into a queue  also called a   8220 partition  8221  in Slurm   For each job in the queue  Slurm constantly tries to find a computer in the cluster with enough resources to run that job  then when an available computer is found runs the program the job specifies on that computer  As the program runs  Slurm records its output to files and finally reports the program  8217 s exit status  either completed or failed  back to the job manager Importantly  jobs can either be marked as interactive or batch  When you submit an interactive job  sbatch will pause while waiting for the job to start and then connect you to the program  so you can see its output and enter commands in real time  On the other hand  a batch job will return immediately  you can see the progress of your job using squeue  and you can typically see the output of the job in the folder from which you ran sbatch unless you specify otherwise Data for or from Slurm work may be stored temporarily on local storage or on user specific external  remote  storage           Wait  what are   8220 nodes  8221  A simplified way to understand the architecture of Slurm on Alpine is through login and compute   8220 nodes  8221   computers  Login nodes act as a place to prepare and submit jobs which will be completed on compute nodes  Login nodes are never used to execute Slurm jobs  whereas compute nodes are exclusively accessed via a job Login nodes have limited resource access and are not recommended for running procedures   One can interact with Slurm on Alpine by use of Slurm interfaces and directives A quick way of accessing Alpine resources is through the use of the acompile command  which starts an interactive job on a compute node with some typical default parameters for the job  Since acompile requests very modest resources  1 hour and 1 CPU core at the time of writing   you  8217 ll typically quickly be connected to a compute node  For more intensive or long lived interactive jobs  consider using sinteractive  which allows for more customization  Interactive Jobs One can also access Slurm directly through various commands on Alpine Many common software packages are available through the Modules package on Alpine  UCB RC documentation  The Modules System  How does Slurm work Diagram showing how Slurm generally works Using Alpine effectively involves knowing how to leverage Slurm A simplified way to understand how Slurm works is through the following sequence Please note that some steps and additional complexity are omitted for the purposes of providing a basis of understanding   Create a job script  build a script which will configure and run procedures related to the work you seek to accomplish on the HPC cluster   Submit job to Slurm  ask Slurm to run a set of commands or procedures   Job queue  Slurm will queue the submitted job alongside others  recall that the HPC cluster is a shared resource   providing information about progress as time goes on   Job processing  Slurm will run the procedures in the job script as scheduled   Job completion or cancellation  submitted jobs eventually may reach completion or cancellation states with saved information inside Slurm regarding what happened How do I store data on Alpine Data used or produced by your processed jobs on Alpine may use a number of different data storage locations Be sure to follow the Acceptable data storage and use policies of Alpine  avoiding the use of certain sensitive information and other items These may be distinguished in two ways       Alpine local storage  sometimes temporary   Alpine provides a number of temporary data storage locations for accomplishing your work    Note  some of these locations may be periodically purged and are not a suitable location for long term data hosting  see here for more information  Storage locations available  see this link for full

storage being used to send or receive data on Alpine local storage Data may be sent to or gathered from Alpine using a number of different methods These may vary contingent on the external data storage being referenced  the code involved  or your group  8217 s available resources Please reference the following documentation from the University of Colorado Boulder  8217 s Research Computing regarding data transfers  The Compute Environment   Data Transfer Please note  due to the authentication configuration of Alpine many local or SSH key based methods are not available for CU Anschutz users As a result  Globus represents one of the best options available  see 3    Transfer data results below   While the Globus tutorial in this document describes how you can download data from

This post is intended to help demonstrate the use of Python on Alpine, a High Performance Compute (HPC) cluster hosted by the University of Colorado Boulder’s Research Computing.
We use Python here by way of Anaconda environment management to run code on Alpine.
This readme will cover a background on the technologies and how to use the contents of an example project repository as though it were a project you were working on and wanting to run on Alpine.

Actions may be specified using YAML files within your repository  8217 s  github workflows directory by using syntax specific to Github  8217 s workflow specification  Each YAML file under the  github

which can help with this is Act  Act uses Docker images which require Docker Desktop to simulate what running a GitHub Action workflow within your local environment  Using Act can sometimes avoid

with tools like Dagger There are times when GitHub Actions may be too constricting or Act may not accurately simulate workflows  We also might seek to   8220 write once  run anywhere  8221   WORA  to enable flexible development on many environments  One workaround to this challenge is to use nested workflows which are compatible with local environments and GitHub Actions environments  Dagger is one tool which enables programmatically specifying and using workflows this way  Using Dagger allows you to trigger workflows on your local machine or GitHub Actions with the same underlying engine  meaning there are fewer inconsistencies or guesswork for developers  see here for an explanation of how Dagger works  There are also other alternatives to Dagger you may want to consider based on your usecase  preference  or interest  Earthly is similar to Dagger and uses   8220 earthfiles  8221  as a specification  Both Dagger and Earthly  in addition to GitHub Actions  use container based approaches  which in and of themselves present additional alternatives outside the scope of this article   GitHub Actions with Nested Workflow ExampleReference this example for a brief demonstration of how GitHub Actions and Dagger may be used together       4 run matrixed pytest dagger yml  demonstrates how to run matrixed Python versions for confirming passing pytest tests using GitHub Actions and Dagger together  A GitHub Actions matrix strategy is used to span concurrent work while retaining the reproducibility from Dagger task specification   Closing RemarksUsing GitHub Actions through the above methods can help automate your technical work and increase the quality of your code with sometimes very little additional effort  Saving time through this form of automation can provide additional flexibility accomplish more complex work which requires your attention  perhaps using timeboxing techniques   Even small amounts of time saved can turn into large opportunities for other work  On this note  be sure to explore how GitHub Actions can improve things for your software endeavors ">
    

There are many routine tasks which can be automated to help save time and increase reproducibility in software development. GitHub Actions provides one way to accomplish these tasks using code-based workflows and related workflow implementations. This type of automation is commonly used to perform tests, builds (preparing for the delivery of the code), or delivery itself (sending the code or related artifacts where they will be used).

assignment       commit id   completed        checkout mainAn example git diagram showing assignment branch based off main Following the course assignment workflow  the diagram above shows an in progress assignment branch based off of the main branch  When the assignment branch is created  we bring into it everything we know from main  the course  so far in the form of commits  or groups of changes to various files  Branching allows us to make consistent and well described changes based on what  8217 s already happened without impacting others work in the meantime   Branching best practices       Keep the name and work with branches dedicated to a specific and focused purpose  For example  a branch named fix links in docs might entail work related to fixing HTTP links within documentation     Consider the use of Github Forks  along with branches within the fork  to help further isolate and enrich work potential  Forks also allow remixing existing work into new possibilities     festina lente or   8220 make haste  slowly  8221   Commits on any branch represent small chunks of a cohesive idea which will eventually be brought to main  It is often beneficial to be consistent with small  gradual commits to avoid a rushed or incomplete submission  The same applies more generally for software  taking time upfront to do things well can mean time saved later

diagram showing assignment branch being merged with main after a review The diagram above depicts a merge from the assignment branch to pull the changes into the main branch  simulating an assignment being returned for review within a course  While merges may be forced without review  it  8217 s a best practice create a Pull Request  PR  Review  also known as a Merge Request  MR  on some systems  and then ask other members of your team to review it  Doing this provides a chance to make revisions before code changes are   8220 finalized  8221  within the main branch   Github provides special tools for reviews which can assist both the author and reviewer       Keep code changes intended for review small  enabling reviewers to reason through the work to more quickly provide feedback and practicing incremental continuous improvement  it may be difficult to address everything at once    This also may denote the git history for a repository in a clearer way     Github comments  Overall review comments  encompassing all work from the branch  and Inline comments  inquiring about individual lines of code  may be provided  Inline comments may also include code suggestions  which allows for code based revision suggestions that may be committed directly to the branch using markdown codeblocks     suggestion        Github issues  Creating issues from comments allows the creation of new repository issues to address topics outside of the current PR   Merging the Branch after Review   init     logLevel    debug    theme    default     themeVariables           git0     6366F1

has been merged  and removed  Changes may be made within the assignment branch until the work is in a state where the authors and reviewers are satisfied  At this point  the branch changes may be merged into main  Approvals are sometimes provided informally  for ex   with a comment    8220 LGTM  looks good to me    8221   or explicitly  for ex   approvals within Github  to indicate or enable branch merge readiness   After the merge  changes may continue to be made in a similar way  perhaps accounting for concurrently branched work elsewhere   Generally  a merged branch may be removed afterwards to help maintain an organized working environment  see Github PR branch removal    Github provides special tools for merging       Decide which merge strategy is appropriate  there are many    There are many merge strategies within Github  merge commits  squash merges  and rebase merging   Take time to understand them and choose which one works best     Consider using branch protection to automate merge requirements  The main or other branches may be   8220 protected  8221  against merges using branch protection rules  These rules can require reviewer approvals or automatic status checks to pass before changes may be merged     Use merge queuing to manage multiple PR  8217 s  When there are many unmerged PR  8217 s  it can sometimes be difficult to document and ensure each are merged in a desired sequence  Consider using merge queues to help with this process   Additional ResourcesThe links below may provide additional guidance on using these git features  including in

Git provides a feature called branching which facilitates parallel and segmented programming work through commits with version control. Using branching enables both work concurrency (multiple people working on the same repository at the same time) as well as a chance to isolate and review specific programming tasks. This article covers some conceptual best practices with branching, reviewing, and merging code using Github.

the content belong to the content creators and not the organization  its affiliates  or employees  If youhave any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week  please don t hesitate to reach out to software engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver onmicrosoft com  Programming often involves long periods of problem solving which can sometimes lead to unproductive or exhausting outcomes  This article covers one way to avoid less productive time expense or protect yourself from overexhaustion through a technique called   8220 timeboxing  8221   also sometimes referenced as   8220 timeblocking  8221   TLDR  too long  didn  8217 t read  Use timeboxing techniques such as Pomodoro  or 52 17 to help modularize your software work to ensure you don  8217 t fall victim to Parkinson  8217 s Law  Timeboxing may also map well to Github Issues  which allows your software tasks to be further aligned  documented  and chunked in collaboration with others Controlling Work Time Expansion                    Image depicting work as a creature with a timebox around it       Have you ever spent more time than you thought you would on a task  An adage which helps explain this phenomenon is Parkinson  8217 s Law     8220   8230  work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion   8221 The practice of writing software is not protected from this   8220 law  8221   It may be affected by it in sometimes worse ways during long periods of uninterrupted programming where we may have an inclination to forget productive goals One way to address this is through the use of timeboxing techiques  Timeboxing sets a fixed limit to the amount of time one may spend on a specific activity  One can use timeboxing to systematically address many tasks  for example  as with the Pomodoro  Technique  developed by Francesco Cirillo  or 52 17 rule  While there are many ways to apply timeboxing  make sure to balance activity with short breaks and focus switches to help ensure we don  8217 t become overwhelmed Timeboxing Means ModularizationTimeboxing has an auxiliary benefit of framing your work as objective and oftentimes smaller chunks  we have to know what we  8217 re timeboxing in order to use this technique   Creating distinct chunks of work applies for both our daily time schedule as well as code itself  This concept is more broadly called   8220 modularization  8221  and helps to distinguish large portions of work  whether in real life or in code  as smaller and more maintainable chunks             Goals  Finish writing paperVague and possibly large task            Goals  Finish writing paper    Create paper outline    Finish writing introduction    Check for dead hyperlinks    Request internal reviewModular and more understandable tasks  Breaking down large amounts of work as smaller chunks within our code helps to ensure long term maintainability and understandability  Similarly  keeping our tasks small can help ensure our goals are achievable and understandable  to ourselves or others   Without this modularity  tasks can be impossible to achieve  subjective in nature  or very difficult to understand  Stated differently  taking many small steps can lead to a big change in an organized  oftentimes less exhausting way  related graphic  Version Control and Timeboxing  Repo Issues   Prevent foo warning    20 minutes   Remove bar feature    20 minutes   Address baz error    20 minutesList of example version control repository issues with associated time duration The parallels between the time we give a task and related code can work towards your benefit  For example  Github Issues can be created to outline a timeboxed task which relates to a distinct chunk of code to be created  updated  or fixed  Once development tasks have been outlined as issues  a developer can use timeboxing to help organize how much time to allocate on each issue Using Github Issues in this way provides a way to observe task progress associated with one or many repositories  It also increases collaborative opportunities for task sizing and description  For example  if a task looks too large to complete in a reasonable amount of time  developers may work together to break the task down into smaller modules of work Be Kind to Yourself  Take BreaksWhile timeboxing is often a conversation about how to be more productive  it  8217 s also worth remembering  take breaks to be kind to yourself and more effective  Some studies and thought leadership have shown that taking breaks may be necessary to avoid performance decreases and impacts to your health  There  8217 s also some indication that taking breaks may lead to better work  See below for just a few examples   The Importance of Taking Breaks

Software documentation is sometimes treated as a less important or secondary aspect of software development. Treating documentation as code allows developers to version control the shared understanding and knowledge surrounding a project. Leveraging this paradigm also enables the use of tools and patterns which have been used to strengthen code maintenance. This article covers one such pattern: linting, or static analysis, for documentation treated like code.

The act of creating software often involves many iterations of writing, personal collaborations, and testing. During this process it’s common to lose awareness of code which is no longer used, and thus may not be tested or otherwise linted. Unused code may contribute to “software decay”, the gradual diminishment of code quality or functionality. This post will cover software decay and strategies for addressing unused code to help keep your code quality high.

Diagrams can be a useful way to illuminate and communicate ideas. Free-form drawing or drag and drop tools are one common way to create diagrams. With this tip of the week we introduce another option: diagrams as code (DaC), or creating diagrams by using code.
