[Workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow) consist of sequenced activities used by various systems. Software development uses workflows to help accomplish work the same way each time. Generally, workflow engines consist of start (what triggers a workflow to begin), actions (work being performed in sequence), and an ending (where the work stops). There are [many workflow engines](https://s.apache.org/existing-workflow-systems), including some which help accomplish work alongside version control.

## Github Actions

[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a feature of Github which allows you to run workflows in relation to your code as a [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) tool (including automated testing, builds, and deployments). For example, one can use Github actions to make sure code related to a [Github Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) passes all tests for the repository. Github Actions may be specified using [YAML files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) within your repository's `.github/workflows` directory by using syntax specific to [Github's workflow specification](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions). In addition to running tests, Github Actions

## Testing with Act

  subgraph container ["local simulation container(s)"]
    direction LR
    subgraph workflow [Github Actions Workflow Run]
      direction LR
      start((trigger))
      action --> en((end))
    end
  end
  start --> action
  act[Run Act] -.-> |Simulate\ntrigger| start
  style start fill:#6EE7B7
  style en fill:#FCA5A5

One challenge with Github Actions is a lack of standardized local testing tools. For example, how will you know that a new Github Actions workflow will function as expected (or at all) without pushing to the Github repository? One third-party tool which can help with this is [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act). Act uses [public Docker images](https://github.com/nektos/act#runners) which require [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) to simulate what running a Github Action workflow within your local environment.

## Nested Workflows with Github Actions

  subgraph action ["Nested Workflow (Dagger, etc)"]

    start2((start)) --> actions
    actions --> en2((end))
    en2((end))
  end
  subgraph workflow2 [Local Environment Run]
    direction LR
    run2[run workflow]
    en3((end))
    start3((trigger))
  end
  subgraph workflow [Github Actions Workflow Run]

    en((end))
  end

There are times when Github Actions may be too constricting or Act may not accurately simulate workflows. One workaround to this challenge is to use nested workflows which are compatible with local environments and Github Actions environments. [Dagger](https://docs.dagger.io/) is one tool which enables programmatically specifying and using workflows this way. Using Dagger allows you to trigger workflows on your local machine or Github Actions with the same underlying engine, meaning there are fewer inconsistencies or guesswork for developers (see here for [an explanation of how Dagger works](https://docs.dagger.io/cli#how-does-it-work)).
