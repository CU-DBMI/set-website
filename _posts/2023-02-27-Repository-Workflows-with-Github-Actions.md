# Tip of the Week: Repository Workflows with Github Actions

> Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals. Views expressed in the content belong to the content creators and not the organization, its affiliates, or employees. If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to #software-engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver.onmicrosoft.com

## Workflows

  style en fill:#FCA5A5
```

[Workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow) consist of sequenced activities used by various systems. Software development uses workflows to help accomplish work the same way each time. Generally, workflow engines consist of start (what triggers a workflow to begin), actions (work being performed in sequence), and an ending (where the work stops). There are [many workflow engines](https://s.apache.org/existing-workflow-systems), including some which help accomplish work alongside version control.

## Github Actions

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph workflow [Github Actions Workflow Run]
    direction LR
    
    action["action(s)"] --> en((end))
  end
  start((trigger)) --> action
  style start fill:#6EE7B7
  style en fill:#FCA5A5
```

[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a feature of Github which allows you to run workflows in relation to your code as a [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) tool. For example, one can use Github actions to make sure code related to a [Github Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) passes all tests for the repository. Github Actions may be specified using [YAML files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) within your repository's `.github/workflows` directory by using syntax specific to [Github's workflow specification](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions). In addition to running tests, Github Actions

## Testing with Act

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph container [local simulation container]
    direction LR
    subgraph workflow [Github Actions Workflow Run]
      direction LR
      
      action --> en((end))
    end
    start((trigger)) --> action
  end
  trigger -.-> |run act| start
  style start fill:#6EE7B7
  style en fill:#FCA5A5
```

## Moving Beyond Act

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph container [local simulation container]
    direction LR
    subgraph workflow
      direction LR
      subgraph action [nested container]
        actions
      end
      start((start)) --> action
      action --> en((end))
    end
    
  end
  trigger -.-> |run act| start
  style start fill:#6EE7B7
  style en fill:#FCA5A5
```
