# Tip of the Week: Repository Workflows with Github Actions

> Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals. Views expressed in the content belong to the content creators and not the organization, its affiliates, or employees. If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to #software-engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver.onmicrosoft.com

__TLDR (too long, didn't read);__

## Workflows

```mermaid

  style start fill:#6EE7B7
  style en fill:#FCA5A5
```

[Workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow) consist of sequenced activities used by various systems. Software development uses workflows to help accomplish work the same way each time. Generally, workflow engines consist of start (what triggers a workflow to begin), actions (work being performed in sequence), and an ending (where the work stops). There are [many workflow engines](https://s.apache.org/existing-workflow-systems), including some which help accomplish work alongside version control.

## Github Actions

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph workflow [Github Actions Workflow Run]
    direction LR
    action["action(s)"] --> en((end))
  end
  start((trigger)) --> action
  style start fill:#6EE7B7
  style en fill:#FCA5A5
```

[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a feature of Github which allows you to run workflows in relation to your code as a [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) tool. For example, one can use Github actions to make sure code related to a [Github Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) passes all tests for the repository. Github Actions may be specified using [YAML files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) within your repository's `.github/workflows` directory by using syntax specific to [Github's workflow specification](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions). In addition to running tests, Github Actions

## Testing with Act

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph container ["local simulation container(s)"]
    direction LR
    subgraph workflow [Github Actions Workflow Run]
      direction LR
      action --> en((end))
    end
  end
  start((trigger)) --> action
  simulated[Simulated\ntrigger] -.-> |run act| start
  style start fill:#6EE7B7
  style en fill:#FCA5A5
```

One challenge with Github Actions is a lack of standardized local testing tools. For example, how will you know that a new Github Actions workflow will function as expected (or at all) without pushing to the Github repository? One third-party tool which can help with this is [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act). Act uses [public Docker images](https://github.com/nektos/act#runners) which require [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) to simulate what running a Github Action workflow in Github will look like.

## Nested Workflows with Github Actions

```mermaid
flowchart LR

    subgraph workflow [Github Actions Workflow Run]
      direction LR
      subgraph action [Nested Workflow System]
        direction LR
        actions
        start2((start)) --> actions
        actions --> en2((end))
      end
      
      en2 -.-> en((end))

    
  end
  start((trigger)) -.-> start2
  style start fill:#6EE7B7
  style start2 fill:#D1FAE5
  style en fill:#FCA5A5
  style en2 fill:#FFE4E6
```
