## Introduction

Test coverage is a crucial aspect of software development that helps ensure your code is reliable and bug-free.
By measuring how much of your code is covered by tests, you can identify untested areas and improve overall quality.
In this post, we'll dive into what test coverage is, why it matters, and explore some tools for measuring it.
Let's get started!

## What is Test Coverage?

Test coverage, also known as code coverage, refers to the percentage of your code that is executed when your tests run ([Wikipedia: Code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage)).
It can be broken down into different types: line coverage (how many lines of code are tested), branch coverage (how many branches or decision points are tested), function coverage (how many functions are tested), and statement coverage (how many statements are tested).
By understanding these metrics, you can get a clearer picture of your code's reliability.

## Benefits of Test Coverage

High test coverage ensures your code is reliable and less prone to bugs. 
It helps you identify untested parts of your codebase, facilitating better maintenance and encouraging a culture of quality.
This is balanced by understanding that 100% coverage is often very challenging to achieve and could be harmful in practice.

> "If you are testing thoughtfully and well, I would expect a coverage percentage in the upper 80s or 90s. I would be suspicious of anything like 100% - it would smell of someone writing tests to make the coverage numbers happy, but not thinking about what they are doing." ([Martin Fowler, Test Coverage](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html))

There are often times where you need to make changes to your code which can cause unforeseen issues to arise (for example, when there's coupling to other functionality).
With good test coverage, you can more confidently refactor code during these occasions, knowing that any issues will be quickly caught by your tests.
In short, it's a vital tool for any developer, providing you further insights about software which can otherwise go unseen.

## Tools for Measuring Code Coverage

Different languages have different tools for measuring code coverage.
These tools help you visualize and understand your test coverage, making it easier to spot gaps and improve your tests.
While the implementations may differ in their processing and report formating, they all follow similar principles.
Below are just a few languages and common test coverage tools you can use with them.

- **Python**, [`coverage.py`](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy) is a popular open-source solution which can be paired with [`pytest-cov`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov).
- **R** developers often use [`covr`](https://github.com/r-lib/covr).
- **C++** developers can rely on [`gcov`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/gcov/introduction-to-gcov.html) or [`LCOV`](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).
- **MATLAB** has built-in test coverage features through [`CodeCoveragePlugin`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/types-of-code-coverage-for-matlab-source-code.html).

## Using `coverage.py` for Measuring Test Coverage in Python

`coverage.py` is a powerful tool for measuring code coverage in Python. 
It's easy to set up: just install it via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (or your development environment), run your tests with coverage, and generate reports in various formats.
Interpreting these reports helps you understand which parts of your code need more testing love.

### A quick example of `coverage.py`

The following content may help demonstrate how `coverage.py` and test coverage works.
This example assumes one has installed both `coverage.py` and [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) (a common Python testing framework) using pip (for instance, by using the command `pip install coverage pytest`).

```python
# module.py

def covered_test():
    return "This test has coverage."

def uncovered_test():
    return "This test doesn't have coverage."
```

`module.py` has two functions, one which will be covered by a test and the other which will not.


```python
# test_module.py

from module import covered_test

def test_add():
    assert covered_test() == "This test has coverage."
```

`test_module.py` has one test for `module.covered_test`.
`module.uncovered_test` remains without a test and won't be considered as covered by `coverage.py`.

```bash
# first we process test coverage
$ coverage run -m pytest
# then we show the reported output of
# processed test coverage
$ coverage report
Name             Stmts   Miss  Cover
------------------------------------
module.py            4      1    75%
test_module.py       3      0   100%
------------------------------------
TOTAL                7      1    86%
```

We use the above `coverage.py` commands to first process test coverage and then to show a report about test coverage afterwards.
Notice that `module.py` shows it does not have full coverage, indicating a possible area where we can improve testing.

## Integrating Code Coverage Tools with CI/CD Pipelines

Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) are essential for modern development workflows.
By integrating code coverage tools with CI/CD pipelines, you can automate the process of checking test coverage.
Setting up `coverage.py` with GitHub Actions workflows, for example, maintains high standards and can catch issues early.

## Managing Code Coverage in Workflows
Managing code coverage involves understanding both existing coverage and coverage changes. Strategies like setting coverage thresholds and failing builds on coverage drops help maintain high standards. Comparing current coverage with previous coverage can be done using techniques like hash checks for binary files or storing and comparing coverage reports. This ensures you know exactly what's changed and can act accordingly.

## Example Workflow: Using `coverage.py` with Pre-Commit Hooks
Pre-commit hooks are scripts that run before a commit is finalized. You can set up a pre-commit hook to run tests and generate coverage reports using `coverage.py`. This ensures consistency by comparing reports before and after changes. If there's a significant drop in coverage, the commit can be blocked, maintaining high code quality.

## Best Practices for Maintaining High Test Coverage
Maintaining high test coverage involves writing meaningful tests, regularly updating and reviewing them, avoiding redundancy, and incorporating coverage goals into your development process. By following these best practices, you can ensure your codebase remains robust, maintainable, and less prone to bugs.

## Conclusion
Test coverage is a vital part of software development that helps maintain code quality and reliability. By integrating coverage tools and practices into your workflow, you can ensure your code is thoroughly tested and ready for any changes. Start using test coverage tools in your projects today and experience the benefits firsthand!
