# Tip of the Week: Git Practices

> Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals. Views expressed in the content belong to the content creators and not the organization, its affiliates, or employees. If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to #software-engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver.onmicrosoft.com

__TLDR (too long, didn't read);__

## Strengthening Our Knowledge

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Student
    direction LR
    work["completed\nassignment"]
  end
  subgraph Course
    direction LR
    open["open\nassignment"]
    turn_in["review\nassignment"]
  end
  open --> |works towards| work
  work --> |seeks review| turn_in
  open -.-> turn_in
```

_An example instructor and student assignment workflow._

[Git branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) practices may be simpler to understand in context with similar workflows from real life. Consider a scenario within an educational course where an assignment is made available to a student.

Similarly, it's important to think about _why_ this pattern exists in the context of technical work based around the same:

- Completing an assignment allows us as social beings to present new findings which enable learning and amalgamation of additional ideas from others.
- On their own, our ideas without input could be interpreted as alone, unshared, and incomplete.
- The timebound nature of assignments enables us to practice some form of [timeboxing]() so as to minimize tasks which may take too much time.

## Branching

```mermaid
    gitGraph
       commit id: "..."
       commit id: "opened"
       branch student
       checkout student
       commit id: "completed"
       checkout main
```

_An example git diagram showing student branch being merged with main after review._

Branching allows us to make consistent and well decribed changes based on what's already happened without impacting others work in the meantime. The course assignment workflow can help provide context with how branching may work within git. The diagram above shows a `student` branch based off of the `main` branch. The `main` branch can be thought of as the "course", or the primary place where all others collaborate, including where you'd seek feedback from your peers or an instructor (especially when seeking to merge, as mentioned below). When the `student` branch is created, we bring into it everything we know from `main` (the course) so far.

Commits represent small chunks of a cohesive idea which will eventually be brought back to the commons within `main`. To this effect, keep in mind the saying _festina lente_ or __"make haste slowly"__ ([reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festina_lente)). In other words, it may pay to be consistent with small, gradual commits to avoid rushing completion.

Reference the following commands or steps to create a git branch for your repository.

- Within the command line ([reference](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)):
  1. Create the branch `git branch <branch name>`
  1. Checkout the branch to apply work to the new branch `git checkout <branch name>` (note: checkout for the branch does not occur automatically after branch creation).
- [Branching within the Github desktop application](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches)

## Reviews and Merging

```mermaid
    gitGraph
       commit id: "..."
       commit id: "opened"
       branch student
       checkout student
       commit id: "completed"
       checkout main
       merge student id: "reviewed"
       commit id: "...."

```

 After the `completed` commit takes place on the student branch, a merge is performed to pull the changes into the "main" branch.
