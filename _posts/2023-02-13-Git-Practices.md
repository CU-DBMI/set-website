__TLDR (too long, didn't read);__

## Setting the Scene

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph student
    direction LR
    work["completed\nassignment"]
  end
  subgraph instructor
    direction LR
    open["open\nassignment"]
    turn_in["review\nassignment"]
  end
  open --> |works towards| work
  work --> |seeks review| turn_in
  open -.-> turn_in
```

_An example instructor and student assignment workflow._

```mermaid
    gitGraph
       commit id: "created"
       commit id: "opened"
       branch student
       checkout student
       commit id: "completed"
       checkout main
       merge student id: "reviewed" tag: "Seeks review"
       commit id: "..." 
```

_An example git diagram showing student branch being merged with main after review._
