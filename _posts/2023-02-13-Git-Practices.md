# Tip of the Week: Git Practices

__TLDR (too long, didn't read);__

## Setting the Scene

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Student
    direction LR
    work["completed\nassignment"]
  end
  subgraph Instructor
    direction LR
    open["open\nassignment"]
    turn_in["review\nassignment"]
  end
  open --> |works towards| work
  work --> |seeks review| turn_in
  open -.-> turn_in
```

_An example instructor and student assignment workflow._

[Git branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) practices may be simpler to understand in context with similar workflows from real life. Consider a scenario within an educational course where an assignment is administered. The steps might look like the following:

```markdown
# Course Assignment Workflow
1. An instructor opens an assignment for students to complete
2. A student completes the assignment
3. The student turns in their completed assignment for review or grading.
```

This workflow can help provide context with how branching may work within git. The diagram below shows a "student" branch based off of the "main" branch's "opened" commit. After the "completed" commit takes place on the student branch, a merge is performed to pull the changes into the "main" branch.

```mermaid
    gitGraph
       commit id: "..."
       commit id: "opened"
       branch student
       checkout student
       commit id: "completed"
       checkout main
       merge student id: "reviewed" tag: "Seeks review"
       commit id: ".." 
```
