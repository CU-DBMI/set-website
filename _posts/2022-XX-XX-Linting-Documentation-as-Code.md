# Tip of the Week: Linting Documentation as Code

> Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals. If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to #software-engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver.onmicrosoft.com

[Software documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation) is sometimes treated as a less important or secondary aspect of software development. Treating documentation as code allows developers to version control the shared understanding and knowledge surrounding a project. Leveraging this paradigm also enables the use of tools and patterns which have been used to strengthen code maintenance. This article covers one such pattern: [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)), or static analysis, for documentation treated like code.

## Spelling Checks

<pre class="mermaid">

</pre>
<script type="module">
  import mermaid from 'https://unpkg.com/mermaid@9/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';
  mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });
</script>

[Spelling checks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spell_checker) may be used to automatically detect incorrect spellings of words within your documentation (and code!). [Codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) is one library which can lint your word spelling. Codespell may be used through the command-line and also through a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html) hook.
