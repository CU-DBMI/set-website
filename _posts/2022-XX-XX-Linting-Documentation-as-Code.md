# Tip of the Week: Linting Documentation as Code

> Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals. If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to #software-engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver.onmicrosoft.com

[Software documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation) is sometimes treated as a less important or secondary aspect of software development. Treating documentation as code allows developers to version control the shared understanding and knowledge surrounding a project. Leveraging this paradigm also enables the use of tools and patterns which have been used to strengthen code maintenance. This article covers one such pattern: [linting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)), or static analysis, for documentation treated like code.

__TLDR (too long, didn't read);__
There are many linting tools available which enable quick revision of your documentation. Try using [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) for spelling corrections, [mdformat](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat) for markdown file formatting corrections, and [vale](https://vale.sh/) for more complex editorial style or natural language assessment within your documentation.

## Spelling Checks

```markdown
<!--- readme.md --->
## Example Readme

Thsi project is a wokr in progess.

(CU Anschutz)[https://www.cuanschutz.edu/]
```

_Example readme.md with incorrectly spelled words_

```sh
% codespell readme.md
readme.md:4: Thsi ==> This
readme.md:4: wokr ==> work
readme.md:4: progess ==> progress


```

[Spelling checks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spell_checker) may be used to automatically detect incorrect spellings of words within your documentation (and code!). [Codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) is one library which can lint your word spelling. Codespell may be used through the command-line and also through a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html) hook.

## Markdown Format Linting

```markdown
<!--- readme.md --->
## Example Readme

This project is a work in progress.

(CU Anschutz)[https://www.cuanschutz.edu/]
```

_Example readme.md with markdown issues_

```sh
% markdownlint readme.md
readme.md:2 MD041/first-line-heading/first-line-h1 First line in a file should be a top-level heading [Context: "## Example Readme"]
readme.md:6:5 MD011/no-reversed-links Reversed link syntax [(link)[https://www.cuanschutz.edu/]]



```
