# Tip of the Week: Effective Non-technical Software Habits

> Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals. If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to #software-engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver.onmicrosoft.com

## Timeboxing

Have you ever spent more time than you thought you would on a task? An adage which helps explain this phenomenon is [Parkinson's Law](https://www.economist.com/news/1955/11/19/parkinsons-law):

>"... work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."

The practice of writing software is not protected from this law. It may be effected by it in sometimes worse ways when considering long periods of uninterrupted programming (where we may have an inclination to pour our time into only a few items).

One way to address this is through the use of [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) techiques. Timeboxing sets a fixed limit to the amount of time one may spend on a specific activity. One can use timeboxing to systematically address many tasks, for example, as with the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). This time limit directly addresses Parkinson's Law and helps encourage

## Objective Key Results

Another non-technical challenge when it comes to software work is finding the correct metric to estimate progress without losing focus on larger goals. Making data-based decisions is a common way to achieve measurable progress and keep honest about successes. Measurements alone are flawed in their ability to judge long-term success. Be sure to take [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) into account:

> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"

Stated differently: when we focus only on what we measure, we may lose sight of the important goals. For example, time may be used as a work measure, but more time spent on work isn't equivalent to successful outcomes.
