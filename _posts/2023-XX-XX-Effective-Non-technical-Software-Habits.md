# Tip of the Week: Effective Non-technical Software Habits

> Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals. If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to #software-engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver.onmicrosoft.com

## Controlling Work Expansion

Have you ever spent more time than you thought you would on a task? An adage which helps explain this phenomenon is [Parkinson's Law](https://www.economist.com/news/1955/11/19/parkinsons-law):

>"... work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."

The practice of writing software is not protected from this law. It may be effected by it in sometimes worse ways when considering long periods of uninterrupted programming (where we may have an inclination to pour our time into only a few items).

One way to address this is through the use of [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) techiques. Timeboxing sets a fixed limit to the amount of time one may spend on a specific activity. One can use timeboxing to systematically address many tasks, for example, as with the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). While there are many ways to apply timeboxing, Pomodoro provides a way to balance activity with short breaks and focus switches to help ensure we don't become overwhelmed.

## Timeboxing Means Modularization

Timeboxing has an auxiliary benefit of framing your work as distinct and oftentimes smaller chunks. Creating distinct chunks of work applies for both our daily time schedule as well as code itself. This concept is more broadly called "[modularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity)" and helps to distinguish large portions of work (whether in real life or in code) as smaller and more maintainable chunks.

Breaking down large amounts of work as smaller chunks within our code helps to ensure long-term maintainability and understandability.

## Applied Timeboxing for Software Development

The parallels between the time we give a modularized task and related code modules can work towards your benefit. For example, [Github Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) can be created to outline a timeboxed task which relates to a distinct chunk of code to be created, updated, or fixed.
