# About

We are a small group of dedicated software developers with the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi) at the [University of Colorado Anschutz](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/).

We support the labs and individuals within the Center by developing a variety of content and software.
Some of the things we create are:

- Modern, responsive web applications
- Powerful and flexible backend systems and APIs
- Interactive data visualizations
- Beautiful and polished websites
- Robust and reproducible data pipelines
- Logos and cohesive brand identities

But the best way to understand what we do is to [see it for yourself](../portfolio)!
