  <p data-search="Tip of the Week  Automate Software Workflows with GitHub Actions  Each week we seek to provide a software tip of the week geared towards helping you achieve your software goals  Views expressed in the content belong to the content creators and not the organization  its affiliates  or employees  If you have any software questions or suggestions for an upcoming tip of the week  please don t hesitate to reach out to  software engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver onmicrosoft comThere are many routine tasks which can be automated to help save time and increase reproducibility in software development  GitHub Actions provides one way to accomplish these tasks using code based workflows and related workflow implementations  This type of automation is commonly used to perform tests  builds  preparing for the delivery of the code   or delivery itself  sending the code or related artifacts where they will be used  TLDR  too long  didn t read  Use GitHub Actions to perform continuous integration work automatically by leveraging Github s workflow specification and the existing marketplace of already created Actions  You can test these workflows with Act  which can enhance development with this feature of Github  Consider making use of  write once  run anywhere   WORA  and Dagger in conjunction with GitHub Actions to enable reproducible

workflow Workflows consist of sequenced activities used by various systems  Software development  workflows help accomplish work the same way each time by using what are commonly called  workflow engines   Generally  workflow engines are provided code which indicate beginnings  what triggers a workflow to begin   actions  work being performed in sequence   and an ending  where the workflow stops   There are many workflow engines  including some which help accomplish work alongside version control GitHub Actionsflowchart LR  subgraph workflow  GitHub Actions Workflow Run     direction LR

Actions is a feature of GitHub which allows you to run workflows in relation to your code as a continuous integration  including automated testing  builds  and deployments  and general automation tool  For example  one can use GitHub Actions to make sure code related to a GitHub Pull Request passes certain tests before it is allowed to be merged  GitHub Actions may be specified using YAML files within your repository s  github workflows directory by using syntax specific to Github s workflow specification  Each YAML file under the  github workflows directory can specify workflows to accomplish tasks related to your software work  GitHub Actions workflows may be customized to your own needs  or use an existing marketplace of already created Actions                     Image showing GitHub Actions tab on GitHub website       GitHub provides an  Actions  tab for each repository which helps visualize and control Github Actions workflow runs  This tab shows a history of all workflow runs in the repository  For each run  it shows whether it was run successful or not  the associated logs  and controls to cancel or re run it   GitHub Actions ExamplesGitHub Actions is sometimes better understood with examples  See the following references for a few basic examples of using GitHub Actions in a simulated project repository       1 example action yml  demonstrates how to run a snippet of Python code in a basic GitHub Actions workflow     2 run python file yml  demonstrates how to reliably reproduce the environment by installing dependencies using Poetry  and then

showing how GitHub Actions workflows may be triggered from ActOne challenge with GitHub Actions is a lack of standardized local testing tools  For example  how will you know that a new GitHub Actions workflow will function as expected  or at all  without pushing to the GitHub repository  One third party tool which can help with this is Act  Act uses Docker images which require Docker Desktop to simulate what running a GitHub Action workflow within your local environment  Using Act can sometimes avoid guessing what will occur when a GitHub Action worklow is added to your repository  See Act s

workflows  We also might seek to  write once  run anywhere   WORA  to enable flexible development on many environments  One workaround to this challenge is to use nested workflows which are compatible with local environments and GitHub Actions environments  Dagger is one tool which enables programmatically specifying and using workflows this way  Using Dagger allows you to trigger workflows on your local machine or GitHub Actions with the same underlying engine  meaning there are fewer inconsistencies or guesswork for developers  see here for an explanation of how Dagger works  There are also other alternatives to Dagger you may want to consider based on your usecase  preference  or interest  Earthly is similar to Dagger and uses  earthfiles  as a specification  Both Dagger and Earthly  in addition to GitHub Actions  use container based approaches  which in and of themselves present additional alternatives outside the scope of this article   GitHub Actions with Nested Workflow ExampleReference this example for a brief demonstration of how GitHub Actions and Dagger may be used together       4 run matrixed pytest dagger yml  demonstrates how to run matrixed Python versions for confirming passing pytest tests using GitHub Actions and Dagger together  A GitHub Actions matrix strategy is used to span concurrent work while retaining the reproducibility from Dagger task specification   Closing RemarksUsing GitHub Actions through the above methods can help automate your technical work and increase the quality of your code with sometimes very little additional effort  Saving time through this form of automation can provide additional flexibility accomplish more complex work which requires your attention  perhaps using timeboxing techniques   Even small amounts of time saved can turn into large opportunities for other work  On this note  be sure to explore how GitHub Actions can improve things for your software endeavors ">
    

There are many routine tasks which can be automated to help save time and increase reproducibility in software development. GitHub Actions provides one way to accomplish these tasks using code-based workflows and related workflow implementations. This type of automation is commonly used to perform tests, builds (preparing for the delivery of the code), or delivery itself (sending the code or related artifacts where they will be used).

real life  Consider a student taking a course  where an assignment is given to them to complete  In addition to the steps shown in the diagram above  it s important to think about why this pattern is beneficial   Completing an assignment allows us as social  inter dependent beings to present new findings which enable learning and amalgamation of additional ideas from others   The timebound nature of assignments enables us to practice some form of timeboxing so as to minimize tasks which may take too much time   Segmenting applied learning in distinct  goal orientated chunks helps make larger topics easier to understand Branching to Complete an  Assignment    init     logLevel    debug    theme    default     themeVariables           git0     4F46E5         git1     10B981

example git diagram showing assignment branch based off main Following the course assignment workflow  the diagram above shows an in progress assignment branch based off of the main branch  When the assignment branch is created  we bring into it everything we know from main  the course  so far in the form of commits  or groups of changes to various files  Branching allows us to make consistent and well described changes based on what s already happened without impacting others work in the meantime   Branching best practices       Keep the name and work with branches dedicated to a specific and focused purpose  For example  a branch named fix links in docs might entail work related to fixing HTTP links within documentation     Consider the use of Github Forks  along with branches within the fork  to help further isolate and enrich work potential  Forks also allow remixing existing work into new possibilities     festina lente or  make haste  slowly   Commits on any branch represent small chunks of a cohesive idea which will eventually be brought to main  It is often beneficial to be consistent with small  gradual commits to avoid a rushed or incomplete submission  The same applies more generally for software  taking time upfront to do things well can mean time saved later   Reviewing the Branched Work   init     logLevel    debug    theme    default     themeVariables

above depicts a merge from the assignment branch to pull the changes into the main branch  simulating an assignment being returned for review within a course  While merges may be forced without review  it s a best practice create a Pull Request  PR  Review  also known as a Merge Request  MR  on some systems  and then ask other members of your team to review it  Doing this provides a chance to make revisions before code changes are  finalized  within the main branch   Github provides special tools for reviews which can assist both the author and reviewer       Keep code changes intended for review small  enabling reviewers to reason through the work to more quickly provide feedback and practicing incremental continuous improvement  it may be difficult to address everything at once    This also may denote the git history for a repository in a clearer way     Github comments  Overall review comments  encompassing all work from the branch  and Inline comments  inquiring about individual lines of code  may be provided  Inline comments may also include code suggestions  which allows for code based revision suggestions that may be committed directly to the branch using markdown codeblocks     suggestion        Github issues  Creating issues from comments allows the creation of new repository issues to address topics outside of the current PR   Merging the Branch

merging   Take time to understand them and choose which one works best     Consider using branch protection to automate merge requirements  The main or other branches may be  protected  against merges

to reach out to  software engineering on Slack or email DBMISoftwareEngineering at olucdenver onmicrosoft comProgramming often involves long periods of problem solving which can sometimes lead to unproductive or exhausting outcomes  This article covers one way to avoid less productive time expense or protect yourself from overexhaustion through a technique called  timeboxing   also sometimes referenced as  timeblocking   TLDR  too long  didn t read  Use timeboxing techniques such as Pomodoro  or 52 17 to help modularize your software work to ensure you don t fall victim to Parkinson s Law  Timeboxing may also map well to Github Issues  which allows your software tasks to be further aligned  documented  and chunked in collaboration with others Controlling Work Time Expansion                    Image depicting work as a creature with a timebox around it       Have you ever spent more time than you thought you would on a task  An adage which helps explain this phenomenon is Parkinson s Law      work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion  The practice of writing software is not protected from this  law   It may be affected by it in sometimes worse ways during long periods of uninterrupted programming where we may have an inclination to forget productive goals One way to address this is through the use of timeboxing techiques  Timeboxing sets a fixed limit to the amount of time one may spend on a specific activity  One can use timeboxing to systematically address many tasks  for example  as with the Pomodoro  Technique  developed by Francesco Cirillo  or 52 17 rule  While there are many ways to apply timeboxing  make sure to balance activity with short breaks and focus switches to help ensure we don t become overwhelmed Timeboxing Means ModularizationTimeboxing has an auxiliary benefit of framing your work as objective and oftentimes smaller chunks  we have to know what we re timeboxing in order to use this technique   Creating distinct chunks of work applies for both our daily time schedule as well as code itself  This concept is more broadly called  modularization  and helps to distinguish large portions of work  whether in real life or in code  as smaller and more maintainable chunks             Goals  Finish writing paperVague and possibly large task            Goals  Finish writing paper    Create paper outline    Finish writing introduction    Check for dead hyperlinks    Request internal reviewModular and more understandable tasks  Breaking down large amounts of work as smaller chunks within our code helps to ensure long term maintainability and understandability  Similarly  keeping our tasks small can help ensure our goals are achievable and understandable  to ourselves or others   Without this modularity  tasks can be impossible to achieve  subjective in nature  or very difficult to understand  Stated differently  taking many small steps can lead to a big change in an organized  oftentimes less exhausting way  related graphic  Version Control and Timeboxing  Repo Issues   Prevent foo warning    20 minutes   Remove bar feature    20 minutes   Address baz error    20 minutesList of example version control repository issues with associated time duration The parallels between the time we give a task and related code can work towards your benefit  For example  Github Issues can be created to outline a timeboxed task which relates to a distinct chunk of code to be created  updated  or fixed  Once development tasks have been outlined as issues  a developer can use timeboxing to help organize how much time to allocate on each issue Using Github Issues in this way provides a way to observe task progress associated with one or many repositories  It also increases collaborative opportunities for task sizing and description  For example  if a task looks too large to complete in a reasonable amount of time  developers may work together to break the task down into smaller modules of work Be Kind to Yourself  Take BreaksWhile timeboxing is often a conversation about how to be more productive  it s also worth remembering  take breaks to be kind to yourself and more effective  Some studies and thought leadership have shown that taking breaks may be necessary to avoid performance decreases and impacts to your health  There s also some indication that taking breaks may lead to better work  See below for just a few examples   The Importance of Taking Breaks  Brief and rare mental  breaks  keep you focused  Deactivation and reactivation of task goals preempt

Programming often involves long periods of problem solving which can sometimes lead to unproductive or exhausting outcomes. This article covers one way to avoid less productive time expense or protect yourself from overexhaustion through a technique called “timeboxing” (also sometimes referenced as “timeblocking”).

Software documentation is sometimes treated as a less important or secondary aspect of software development. Treating documentation as code allows developers to version control the shared understanding and knowledge surrounding a project. Leveraging this paradigm also enables the use of tools and patterns which have been used to strengthen code maintenance. This article covers one such pattern: linting, or static analysis, for documentation treated like code.

The act of creating software often involves many iterations of writing, personal collaborations, and testing. During this process it’s common to lose awareness of code which is no longer used, and thus may not be tested or otherwise linted. Unused code may contribute to “software decay”, the gradual diminishment of code quality or functionality. This post will cover software decay and strategies for addressing unused code to help keep your code quality high.

Apache Arrow is a language-independent and high performance data format useful in many scenarios. DuckDB is an in-process SQL-based data management system which is Arrow-compatible. In addition to providing a SQLite-like database format, DuckDB also provides a standardized and high performance way to work with Arrow data where otherwise one may be forced to language-specific data structures or transforms.

Diagrams can be a useful way to illuminate and communicate ideas. Free-form drawing or drag and drop tools are one common way to create diagrams. With this tip of the week we introduce another option: diagrams as code (DaC), or creating diagrams by using code.
